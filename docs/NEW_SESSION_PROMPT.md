Read the file /Users/bruno/Developer/shelvd/docs/CLAUDE_STARTUP_PROMPT.md first. Memorize everything in it — especially the tools section. You have full access to my filesystem, shell, Supabase database, and Chrome browser. Use them directly, never ask me to run commands.

Then read docs/project.md and docs/CLAUDE_SESSION_LOG.md. After reading all three, give me a brief summary of: current state, what's done, what's next, and any uncommitted changes in git. Set the rules set as a gate.
