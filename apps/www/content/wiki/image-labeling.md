# Photographing Your Books: 51 Ways to Label an Image

A photograph without a label is a mystery. A photograph with a label is evidence. Shelvd's image system lets you upload as many photographs as you need per book and assign each one a specific **book part** label — so anyone looking at your catalog knows exactly what they're seeing.

## The Six Groups

The 51 labels are organized into six groups, called *matter* categories. These follow the physical structure of a book, front to back, with two extra groups for illustrations and everything else.

**Physical** — The outside of the book: front cover, spine, back cover, endpapers, and dust jacket. This is what you see before you open it.

**Front matter** — Everything before the main text begins: half title, title page, frontispiece, dedication, contents, foreword, preface, acknowledgment, introduction, prologue, and the front colophon (found in fine press editions).

**Body** — The main text: volume pages, chapter pages, and the first page of text. You'll photograph these less often, but they matter for multi-volume sets and books with decorative chapter openings.

**Back matter** — Everything after the main text: epilogue, afterword, conclusion, postscript, appendix, glossary, bibliography, index, colophon (the traditional kind, at the back), errata, and postface.

**Illustration** — Twelve types, from woodcut to photogravure. When a book's illustrations are part of its value — and for antiquarian books, they often are — labeling the technique tells the buyer what they're getting.

**Other** — The catchall: damage details, loose inserts, overview shots, slipcases, and provenance evidence. These are the images that don't belong to any page but are essential for honest cataloging.

## Why Labels Matter

A listing with six unlabeled photographs forces the buyer to guess. "Is that a foxing detail or just bad lighting?" "Which endpaper is this?" "Is this the front or back of the dust jacket?"

Labels eliminate guessing. When your images say "Front endpaper (FEP)" and "Damage detail" and "Dust Jacket — Front," the buyer can evaluate the book without asking questions. Questions are friction. Friction kills sales.

For insurance purposes, labeled images create a visual inventory that an appraiser or loss adjuster can work with. "Frontispiece: present" is worth more than a folder of unnamed JPEGs.

## What to Photograph (The Practical Guide)

### For Every Book (Minimum)

1. **Front cover** — The identification image. Shows binding material, title stamping, and overall condition.
2. **Spine** — The part buyers see on a shelf. Title, author, any gilt work. Also the part most likely to be sunned, faded, or cracked.
3. **Title page** — The bibliographic source of truth. For antiquarian books, this is non-negotiable.

### For Books You're Selling

Add to the minimum:

4. **Back cover** — Boards condition, labels, bumping.
5. **Front endpaper** — Where bookplates, inscriptions, and bookseller labels live.
6. **Dust jacket (front and back)** — If present. For post-1920 first editions, the jacket can account for most of the book's market value.
7. **Any defects** — Use the "Damage detail" label. Close-ups of foxing, tears, wormholes, water stains, rebacking evidence. Honesty here saves you returns and builds reputation.

### For Valuable or Rare Books

Add to the above:

8. **Frontispiece** — If present. A missing frontispiece reduces value; documenting its presence protects yours.
9. **Colophon** — Edition numbers, printer's marks, limitation statements.
10. **Provenance evidence** — Bookplates, stamps, signatures, monograms, auction lot labels. Link these to a provenance entry for full context.
11. **Binding details** — Raised bands, gilt tooling, clasps, ties. The craftsmanship that makes fine bindings fine.
12. **Slipcase or box** — If present. Enclosure condition affects overall grading.

### For Illustrated Books

Use the specific illustration labels: woodcut, wood engraving, etching, metal engraving, lithograph, tinted lithograph, halftone, copper engraving, photogravure, hand-colored, or the generic B&W and color options. If you know the technique, say so — it demonstrates expertise and adds value to the listing.

## Uploading and Labeling in Shelvd

### Setting a Default Label

Before uploading, the **Label for new images** dropdown at the top of the Images section sets the default label for all images in that upload batch. If you're photographing five title pages in a row, set it to "Title page" and upload them all at once.

### Relabeling After Upload

Mistakes happen. Click any image in the grid to select it — it gets a red border — and a relabel dropdown appears below the grid. Choose the correct label, and the change saves immediately. The antiquarian description for the selected label appears below the dropdown, so you can confirm you've picked the right one.

Click the X button or click the image again to deselect.

### Upload Limits

Images are stored at their original resolution. Shelvd generates thumbnails automatically. There is no hard limit on the number of images per book — photograph what needs documenting.

## A Note on Illustration Techniques

If you're unsure which illustration label to use, the generic options (B&W or Color) are always available. But identifying the technique adds real value. A few quick rules:

- **Woodcut** — Bold black lines, sometimes rough. Ink sits on raised surfaces. The oldest technique in printed books.
- **Wood engraving** — Fine cross-hatched lines on white. Much more detailed than woodcuts. Think Bewick's birds.
- **Etching** — Soft, free-flowing lines that look drawn. The plate was bitten by acid, not cut.
- **Engraving** — Precise, mechanical-looking lines that swell and taper. The burin was pushed through the metal.
- **Lithograph** — Flat, often crayon-like textures. No plate impression in the paper.
- **Halftone** — Visible dots under magnification. All photographic reproductions since the 1880s.
- **Hand-colored** — Every copy is slightly different. Watercolor sits on top of a printed outline.

When in doubt, say "B&W Illustration" or "Color Illustration." When in less doubt, say what it is. Buyers of illustrated books know the difference between an original etching and a halftone reproduction, and they pay accordingly.
