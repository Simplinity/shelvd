# ISBD: The Catalog Entry Nobody Writes by Hand Anymore

ISBD stands for International Standard Bibliographic Description. It's the formal way to describe a book in a single structured paragraph — the kind of entry you see in library catalogs, auction records, and the dreams of very specific people.

## What It Looks Like

A complete ISBD entry looks something like this:

> Tolkien, J.R.R. — The Lord of the Rings / J.R.R. Tolkien. — First edition. — London : George Allen & Unwin, 1954-1955. — 3 volumes : maps ; 22 cm

Every punctuation mark is prescribed. The dash-space-dash separates areas. The slash introduces the statement of responsibility. The colon precedes the publisher. The semicolon precedes dimensions. None of this is optional, accidental, or decorative.

## The Eight Areas

ISBD divides a description into areas, each handling a specific aspect:

1. **Title and statement of responsibility** — title, subtitle, authors
2. **Edition** — edition statement
3. **Material specific** — (for non-book materials)
4. **Publication** — place, publisher, date
5. **Physical description** — pagination, illustrations, dimensions
6. **Series** — series name and number
7. **Notes** — anything else
8. **Standard number** — ISBN

## Shelvd's ISBD Generator

Shelvd generates ISBD entries automatically from your cataloging data. You don't need to know the punctuation rules — the system assembles the entry from the fields you've filled in.

The generator works in **four languages**: English, Dutch, French, and German. The language affects connecting words and abbreviations ("p." vs "blz." vs "S." for pages).

The generated entry appears in the **Catalog Entry** field on the Edit page. You can accept the auto-generated version or edit it manually if you need to.

## When to Care

Most collectors will never need to touch the ISBD entry directly. It's generated, it's correct, and it lives in the background.

But if you're:
- **Preparing a dealer catalog** — ISBD entries are the professional standard
- **Submitting records to a union catalog** — they'll expect ISBD format
- **Comparing editions** — the structured format makes differences visible
- **Simply a cataloging enthusiast** — no judgment here

...then knowing what ISBD is and how Shelvd generates it is useful knowledge.

## A Love Letter to Punctuation

ISBD is one of the few systems where punctuation carries semantic meaning. A period-space-dash-space is not decoration — it's a field separator. A slash is not casual — it marks the beginning of the statement of responsibility. A semicolon before dimensions is not a stylistic choice — it's a rule.

In a world of loose formatting and ambiguous metadata, ISBD is a fortress of precision. Whether you find that comforting or oppressive says a lot about you as a collector.
