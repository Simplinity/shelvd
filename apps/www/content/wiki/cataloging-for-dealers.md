# Cataloging to Sell: What Buyers Actually Look For

*Professional standards for dealer catalogs, the fields that matter for sales, and why your description is your reputation.*

## The Dealer's Dilemma

A collector catalogs for themselves. A dealer catalogs for strangers. This changes everything.

When you catalog your own books, you know what you mean by "good condition." Your future self will understand. But a buyer in another country, looking at your listing on a screen, needs precision. "Good" means nothing without context. "Light foxing to prelims, else clean; original cloth, slightly rubbed at extremities, spine sunned; hinges firm" means everything.

## The Essential Fields

### Non-Negotiable (every listing needs these)

**Title and author** — as they appear on the title page. Not shortened, not paraphrased. If the title page says "The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner," that's the title.

**Edition and impression** — buyers pay for specificity. "First edition, first impression" means something very different from "first edition, third impression." If you don't know, say so. "First edition (impression not stated)" is honest.

**Condition** — the most scrutinized field in any listing. Use standard grades (Fine, Near Fine, Very Good, etc.) and then *describe*. The grade is the summary; the description is the evidence.

**Price** — obviously.

### Strongly Recommended

**Publication details** — publisher, place, year. These identify the specific edition.

**Physical description** — format, pagination, binding type. Buyers want to know what they're getting physically.

**ISBN/identifiers** — for modern books, the ISBN nails the edition. For older books, reference numbers (Wing, STC, Brunet, etc.) do the same.

**Illustrations** — type (woodcut, engraving, photograph), quantity, notable artists.

**Provenance** — for antiquarian books, provenance can multiply value. Former owner bookplates, inscriptions, association copies.

## Condition Descriptions That Sell

### Be Honest
The fastest way to lose a customer is to over-grade. "Very Good" is not the same as "Fine." If the book has foxing, say so. If the dust jacket is price-clipped, say so. Buyers expect flaws in old books. They don't expect surprises.

### Be Specific
"Some wear" tells the buyer nothing. "Rubbed at corners, light shelf wear to foot of spine, small closed tear (2cm) to top edge of front board" tells them everything. Specificity builds trust.

### Be Systematic
Follow a consistent order: binding → text block → dust jacket → extras. Start outside, work in. The buyer should be able to picture the book in their hands.

### Template for condition notes:
1. **Binding:** material, condition, decoration
2. **Spine:** label, gilt, sunning, wear
3. **Boards/covers:** rubbing, staining, bumps
4. **Hinges and joints:** firm, cracked, repaired
5. **Text block:** foxing, toning, marginalia, completeness
6. **Dust jacket:** chips, tears, fading, price-clipping
7. **Extras:** slipcase, maps, plates, inserts — all present?

## Photography

A photo doesn't replace a description, but it supports one. Photograph:

- Front cover
- Spine
- Any significant defects
- Title page (for antiquarian books)
- Dust jacket (if present)

Good lighting, neutral background, no filters. This isn't Instagram; it's evidence.

## Standards Worth Knowing

**ILAB standards** — The International League of Antiquarian Booksellers has guidelines for description. If you're a member (or aspire to be), follow them.

**AB Bookman's condition grades** — The widely-used scale (Fine through Poor) that the trade relies on. See [Condition Grading](/wiki/condition-grading).

**ISBD** — International Standard Bibliographic Description. The professional standard for catalog entries. Shelvd generates these automatically. See [ISBD](/wiki/the-isbd-entry).
