# Fine, Near Fine, and the Lies We Tell Ourselves

Condition grading is the most subjective part of book collecting disguised as an objective system. The entire antiquarian trade uses the same terms. Nobody agrees on what they mean.

## The Grading Scale

Shelvd uses the standard scale recognized by the ABAA, ILAB, and most professional booksellers:

**Fine (F)**: As new. No defects, no signs of use, no evidence that a human has ever touched this book — which, given that you're holding it, is already a philosophical problem. A truly Fine book looks like it came off the press this morning.

**Near Fine (NF)**: Almost Fine but with a minor defect — a tiny bump to one corner, the faintest hint of toning to the spine. The kind of flaw you'd only notice if you were looking for it, which you were, because you're a collector.

**Very Good (VG)**: Shows some signs of wear but still an attractive, well-preserved copy. Minor rubbing, light foxing, a small closed tear. The book has been read and handled but not abused.

**Good (G)**: A complete, intact copy with noticeable wear. Heavier foxing, bumped corners, a faded spine, rubbing to extremities. Structurally sound but visually tired. Despite the name, "Good" is not good — it's the grade where dealers start apologizing.

**Fair**: Heavy wear, possible damage, but still complete. The reading copy — the book you buy because you want the text, not the object.

**Poor**: Significant damage. Loose or missing pages, broken hinges, heavy staining. The book exists, but only technically.

## Dust Jacket Condition

Dust jackets are graded separately because they're made of paper and suffer differently than bindings. A "Fine" book might have a "Very Good" jacket (spine faded, small chips to edges). The jacket is often the most fragile part and the most valuable — a first edition of *The Great Gatsby* without a jacket is worth a fraction of one with.

## Condition Notes

The grade is shorthand. The notes are where you tell the truth.

Good condition notes are specific, factual, and complete:

> "Foxing to prelims and edges of text block, not affecting plates. Spine lightly sunned with small loss to head. Contemporary half calf, corners rubbed to boards. Previous owner's bookplate on front pastedown (armorial, unidentified). Hinges firm. A very good copy overall."

Bad condition notes are vague, euphemistic, or absent:

> "Some wear."

In Shelvd, the **Condition Notes** field is a text area. Use it generously. Your future self — or anyone looking at the record — will thank you.

## The Honesty Problem

Sellers grade up. Buyers grade down. This is the eternal tension of the trade.

As a collector cataloging your own library, you have no one to impress and no one to deceive. Grade honestly. That "Very Good" book with the broken hinge? It's "Good" at best. That "Fine" book you bought online that arrived with a remainder mark? Near Fine, generously.

Honest grading makes your catalog useful. Flattering grading makes it fiction.
