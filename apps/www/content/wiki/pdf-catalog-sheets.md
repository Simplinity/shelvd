# The Catalog Sheet: One Page Per Book

*PDF generation for professional documentation — what's included, which sizes are available, and when a printed page is still the best technology.*

---

## What It Is

The Catalog Sheet is a **one-page PDF** generated from a book's metadata in Shelvd. It's a professional-grade document that summarizes everything you've recorded about a book: title, contributors, edition, physical description, condition, provenance, valuation, identifiers, and notes.

One book, one page, everything a buyer, insurer, or appraiser needs.

## When to Use It

- **Book fairs** — Print sheets for your stock. Hand them to interested buyers. They look more professional than scribbled notes on index cards.
- **Client communication** — Email a PDF to a prospective buyer or consignor. It shows you take your business seriously.
- **Insurance** — Your insurer wants documentation? Give them a stack of catalog sheets. Each one is a timestamped record of what you own and what it's worth.
- **Appraisals** — When a valuer assesses your collection, catalog sheets give them a head start.
- **Your own records** — A printed backup of your digital data. Paper doesn't need a password, doesn't crash, and survives power outages.

## Paper Sizes

Shelvd generates catalog sheets in six sizes:

| Size | Dimensions | Best for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **A4** | 210 × 297 mm | European standard |
| **A5** | 148 × 210 mm | Half-page, compact |
| **A6** | 105 × 148 mm | Postcard size |
| **US Letter** | 216 × 279 mm | American standard |
| **US Legal** | 216 × 356 mm | American legal |
| **US Half Letter** | 140 × 216 mm | Statement size |

Choose the size that matches your printer and purpose. A4 and US Letter are the most common. A5 is useful for tucking into a book at a fair.

## How to Generate

1. Navigate to the **book detail page**
2. Click the **PDF button** (document icon) in the header
3. Select your paper size from the dropdown
4. The PDF opens in a new tab — print or save

The PDF is generated on the fly from your current data. If you update the book's metadata and generate again, the new PDF reflects the changes.

---

## Availability

The PDF Catalog Sheet is a **Collector Pro** feature. It's available to users on the Collector Pro and Dealer tiers.

---

## Design

The catalog sheet follows Shelvd's design language: clean typography, structured layout, no decoration. It's designed to be read, not admired. The focus is on the data.

Header includes the book title and your name (from your profile). Footer includes the generation date. This way, every sheet is a timestamped, attributed document.
