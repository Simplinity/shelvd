# Measuring Your Books (Without Being Weird About It)

Physical description is the part of cataloging that requires a ruler, some patience, and a willingness to count pages in Roman numerals. It's also the part that tells a buyer, a librarian, or a future you exactly what the object looks like.

## Height, Width, and Depth

Shelvd records dimensions in **millimeters**. Measure the **binding**, not the text block:

- **Height**: The vertical measurement of the book standing upright. Measure from head to tail. This is the primary bibliographic measurement.
- **Width**: The horizontal measurement from spine to fore-edge at the widest point.
- **Depth**: The thickness from spine to fore-edge (optional, but useful for shelf planning).

A standard modern octavo might be 220 × 145 × 25 mm. A folio could be 380 × 260 × 50 mm. Your grandmother's pocket prayer book might be 95 × 65 × 12 mm.

## Weight

Weight in **grams**. Optional but useful for shipping calculations, insurance, and identifying variant editions (a book that's 200g heavier than expected might have different paper stock).

## Pagination

This is where cataloging becomes an art form. Pagination describes the page count using the standard bibliographic notation:

- **Roman numerals** for preliminary pages: i–xvi
- **Arabic numerals** for the main text: 1–352
- **Square brackets** for unnumbered pages: [4] leaves of plates
- **Leaves** vs. **pages**: a leaf has two sides; a page is one side

Example: `xvi, 352 p., [8] leaves of plates`

This means: 16 preliminary pages numbered in Roman, 352 text pages in Arabic, and 8 unnumbered leaves of plates.

Don't be intimidated. For most modern books, just count the last numbered page: "352 p." is perfectly fine.

## Format

Bibliographic format refers to how the original sheets were folded:

- **Folio (2°)** — folded once: 2 leaves, 4 pages per sheet
- **Quarto (4°)** — folded twice: 4 leaves, 8 pages
- **Octavo (8°)** — folded three times: 8 leaves, 16 pages
- **Duodecimo (12mo)** — four folds: 12 leaves

Shelvd has 76 formats in its database, from broadsheet to 128mo. The **Format** dropdown lists them all with their standard abbreviations.

Important: format is about how the book was *manufactured*, not how big it is. A large octavo and a small quarto can be the same height. The format tells you about the printing, not the shelf space.

## Volumes

If the work spans multiple physical volumes, record the count: "3" means three physical books. Combined with the title ("Works of Shakespeare, Vol. II"), this lets you track multi-volume sets accurately.

## Collation and Signatures

For advanced bibliographic description, the **Signatures** field records how gatherings are signed: `A–Z⁸, Aa–Cc⁸`. This is the fingerprint of how the book was physically constructed — essential for identifying editions of hand-press books and fascinating to approximately seven people per country.

## Images

Photographs of your book live in their own **Images** section on the edit page, separate from the physical description fields. Each uploaded image is labeled with a specific book part (title page, frontispiece, binding detail, etc.) from a list of 51 types. This isn't just gallery management — labeled images make your catalog entries more useful for buyers, insurers, and researchers.
