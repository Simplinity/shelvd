# A Visual Guide to Foxing, Toning, and Everything Brown

*The vocabulary of paper degradation, binding wear, and honest condition reporting. What each term means, what it looks like, and when to use it.*

## Paper Conditions

### Foxing
**What it looks like:** Scattered brown or reddish-brown spots on paper, ranging from pinhead-size to several millimeters.
**What causes it:** Still debated. The two main theories: (1) fungal growth encouraged by moisture; (2) oxidation of iron particles in the paper. Probably both.
**How to describe it:** "Light foxing to prelims" (common, minor). "Heavy foxing throughout" (significant, affects value). "Scattered foxing, not affecting text" (moderate, reassuring).

### Toning
**What it looks like:** Uniform yellowing or warming of the paper, as if someone held a tea bag over every page.
**What causes it:** Oxidation of lignin in the paper. More common in wood-pulp paper (post-1850) than rag paper.
**How to describe it:** "Pages toned" (general). "Text block evenly toned, as usual for this period" (contextual, honest).

### Browning
**What it looks like:** Darker than toning — the paper has turned distinctly brown, sometimes unevenly.
**What causes it:** Advanced oxidation, often combined with acidity. Common in books from 1850–1950, the era of cheap acidic paper.
**How to describe it:** "Browning to margins" (edges affected). "Pages browned and brittle" (severe, structural concern).

### Spotting
**What it looks like:** Random stains or discolorations that aren't foxing. Could be water, ink, food, or unidentifiable substances.
**How to describe it:** "Occasional spotting" (mild). "Large stain to pp. 45-48" (specific, honest). "Stain of unknown origin to frontispiece" (diplomatic).

### Offsetting
**What it looks like:** A ghost image transferred from one page to its facing page, or from an illustration to the adjacent text page.
**What causes it:** Ink or pigment migration over time, especially when the book is stored closed.
**How to describe it:** "Offsetting from frontispiece to title page" (specific). "Mild offsetting from plates" (general).

### Damp staining
**What it looks like:** Tideline marks — brownish rings or borders where water reached and then dried.
**What causes it:** Water damage. The stain marks the boundary of the moisture.
**How to describe it:** "Damp stain to lower corner of first 20 leaves" (specific). "Evidence of old damp, now dried" (historical, stabilized).

### Brittleness
**What it looks like:** Paper that cracks or chips when handled. Edges may be broken or flaking.
**What causes it:** Advanced acid degradation. The paper has lost its flexibility.
**How to describe it:** "Pages brittle at edges" (marginal). "Paper brittle throughout, handling with care required" (severe).

## Binding Conditions

### Rubbed
**What it looks like:** Light surface wear, usually on corners, edges, and spine. The cloth or leather has lost its original texture in spots.
**Severity:** The mildest form of wear. Almost universal in used books. "Slightly rubbed" barely merits mention for books over 50 years old.

### Bumped
**What it looks like:** Corners that have been knocked or compressed, losing their sharp edge.
**Severity:** Minor. "Corners bumped" is one of the most common condition notes. It means someone dropped the book, or shelved it carelessly, or both.

### Scuffed
**What it looks like:** More visible surface damage than rubbing — scratches or abrasions on the binding.
**Severity:** Moderate. More noticeable than rubbing, less severe than torn.

### Sunned / Faded
**What it looks like:** The spine (or exposed cover) has lost color from light exposure. A dark blue cloth becomes pale; a red becomes pink.
**Severity:** Moderate. Spine sunning is extremely common and reduces value for collector-grade copies.

### Shaken
**What it looks like:** The text block has started to loosen from the binding. Pages may move slightly when the book is held spine-down.
**Severity:** Moderate to significant. The book still functions but is heading toward structural failure.

### Cocked
**What it looks like:** The spine leans to one side, usually from being shelved leaning. The book doesn't stand straight.
**Severity:** Mild to moderate. Mostly cosmetic but indicates long-term stress.

### Cracked (joint/hinge)
**What it looks like:** A visible break along the joint (exterior) or hinge (interior) where the cover meets the spine.
**Severity:** Significant. A cracked hinge means the cover will eventually detach.

### Detached
**What it looks like:** The cover is no longer attached to the text block.
**Severity:** Severe. The book needs rebinding or repair.

### Worn
**What it looks like:** General wear beyond rubbing — the binding shows significant use.
**Severity:** Moderate. "Binding worn" is an honest catch-all for books that have been well-used.

## Text Block Conditions

### Tight
**What it means:** The text block is firmly bound and doesn't spread easily when opened. Generally desirable, though it can make reading difficult.

### Loose
**What it means:** Pages or gatherings are no longer firmly held. The opposite of tight.

### Sprung
**What it means:** The text block has been forced open too far, damaging the sewing. The book won't close flat.

### Tender
**What it means:** The paper is weakened and tears easily with normal handling.

## Dust Jacket Conditions

### Chipped
**What it looks like:** Small pieces missing from the edges, usually the top and bottom of the spine panel.

### Torn
**What it looks like:** Rips in the jacket paper. Can be short tears at folds or long tears across panels.

### Price-clipped
**What it looks like:** The corner of an inner flap (usually front) has been cut off to remove the printed price.
**Note:** Price-clipping indicates the book was given as a gift. It reduces the jacket's completeness and therefore value, but it's so common as to be expected on many mid-20th century books.

### Creased
**What it looks like:** Fold lines in the jacket, usually across the flaps or spine panel.

### Soiled
**What it looks like:** General surface dirt, marks, or discoloration from handling.

## Condition Grades (Summary)

| Grade | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| **Fine (F)** | As new. No defects. Essentially perfect. |
| **Near Fine (NF)** | Almost fine — very minor signs of age or handling. |
| **Very Good (VG)** | Shows some wear but no major defects. A well-cared-for used book. |
| **Good (G)** | Shows wear and perhaps minor damage. Complete and readable. |
| **Fair** | Significant wear or damage. A reading copy, not a collector's copy. |
| **Poor** | Heavy damage. Incomplete, falling apart, or severely damaged. |
