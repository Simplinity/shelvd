# Everything in Settings, Explained

*Profile, security, locale, currency, and all the knobs you can turn. A guided tour of the preferences page.*

## Getting There

Click your avatar (or initials) in the top-right corner, then **Settings**. Or navigate directly to `/settings`. The page is organized into tabs, each covering a different aspect of your account.

## Account

### Profile
Your name, email, and display preferences. The name you enter here appears in exports, PDF catalog sheets, and (eventually) public profiles.

### Security
Password management. If you signed up with email/password, you can change your password here. If you used SSO (Google, etc.), this section politely has nothing to offer you.

### Address
Your physical address. Used for shipping calculations if you ever sell through the platform, and for regional defaults (currency, locale). Not displayed publicly. Not sold to anyone. Not even looked at, really, unless you ask us to.

### Subscription
Your current tier (Collector, Collector Pro, or Dealer), billing status, and upgrade options. If you're on the free tier and wondering what you're missing, this is where you find out.

### Danger Zone
Account deletion. The red section at the bottom that exists because GDPR says it must, and because sometimes people do want to delete their accounts. This is permanent. Your books, your data, your provenance chains — all gone. We'll ask you to confirm. Twice.

## Configuration

### Currency
Your **display currency** — the currency used throughout the app for value totals, statistics, and reports. This doesn't change the currency you entered for individual books. It converts everything to one currency for display using daily ECB exchange rates.

Choose from 29 ISO 4217 currencies. Default: EUR (because the developer is Belgian, and Belgium is in the eurozone, and these things have consequences).

### Locale
Controls how numbers and dates are formatted. `en-GB` gives you "1,234.56" and "12 February 2026." `nl-BE` gives you "1.234,56" and "12 februari 2026." `de-DE` gives you "1.234,56" and "12. Februar 2026." Pick the one that looks right to you.

### Items Per Page
How many books to show per page in the books list. Options: 25, 50, 100, 200. If you have 5,000 books and choose 200, you'll have 25 pages. If you choose 25, you'll have 200 pages. Mathematics is consistent like that.

## Book Lookup

Configure which library providers are active and in what order. See [Configuring Providers](/wiki/configuring-providers) for the full guide.

---

## External Links

Configure which external link types are available when adding links to your books. See [Configuring Links](/wiki/configuring-links) for the full guide.

---

## Collections

Manage your collections: rename, reorder, delete custom collections. Your Library and Wishlist collections are defaults that can't be deleted (but can be renamed if you're the type who prefers "Bibliotheca" over "Library").

See [Collections and Tags](/wiki/collections-and-tags) for the full guide.

## Tags

Create, edit, and manage your tags. Each tag has a name and a color. Tags are unique per user — your "First Editions" tag is yours alone.

See [Collections and Tags](/wiki/collections-and-tags) for the full guide.
