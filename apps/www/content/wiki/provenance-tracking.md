# Who Had This Book Before You (And Why That Matters)

Every book has a history that extends beyond its text. Who owned it, how it passed between hands, what evidence they left behind — this is provenance, and in the rare book world, it can matter as much as the text itself.

## The Provenance Chain

In Shelvd, provenance is tracked as an ordered chain of ownership entries. Each entry represents one owner or significant event in the book's history, from the earliest known owner to you.

Each provenance entry can include:

- **Owner name** — who had the book
- **Owner type** — individual, institution, bookseller, auction house, library, religious house, royal/noble household
- **Date range** — when they had it (approximate dates are fine: "c. 1750," "before 1900")
- **Evidence type** — how you know this: bookplate, inscription, stamp, binding, catalog reference, armorial
- **Association type** — the relationship: owner, dedicatee, annotator, censor, thief (yes, this happens)
- **Price paid** — if known, what the owner paid (auto-syncs to valuation history)
- **Notes** — anything else: "Presented to the library by the author," "Purchased at Sotheby's lot 234"

## Building the Chain

On the book's Edit page, scroll to the Provenance section. Add entries in chronological order — earliest owner first, most recent last. You can drag entries to reorder them.

A typical chain might look like:

1. **Aldus Manutius** (printer, 1502) — Evidence: colophon
2. **Jean Grolier** (owner, c. 1510–1565) — Evidence: binding with "IO. GROLIERII ET AMICORVM"
3. **Unknown** (c. 1565–1820) — Evidence: gap in the record
4. **Sir Thomas Phillipps** (owner, 1820–1872) — Evidence: MS number on flyleaf
5. **Sotheby's** (auction house, 1946) — Evidence: sale catalog, lot 189
6. **You** (owner, 2024–present) — Evidence: receipt

## Why Track Provenance?

**Value**: A book owned by a famous collector, author, or historical figure is worth more than the same book without that history. Jean Grolier's books sell for tens of thousands. A book from a monastery dissolved during the Reformation carries centuries of context.

**Authentication**: Provenance helps establish that a book is what it claims to be. A continuous chain of ownership from a known source is evidence of authenticity.

**History**: Every book is a physical artifact that passed through human hands. The ink stain from a seventeenth-century reader, the bookplate of a Victorian collector, the auction label from a wartime sale — these are the book's biography.

**Insurance**: Provenance documentation strengthens insurance claims. If you can demonstrate the book's history, you can better establish its value.

## Evidence Types in Shelvd

Shelvd offers specific evidence categories:

- **Bookplate** (ex libris) — printed or engraved ownership label
- **Inscription** — handwritten ownership note
- **Stamp** — ink stamp of owner or institution
- **Binding** — ownership evidence in the binding itself (arms, monogram)
- **Armorial** — coat of arms identifying the owner
- **Catalog reference** — cited in a known catalog or bibliography
- **Manuscript note** — marginalia or annotations attributable to an owner
- **Label** — bookseller's or auction label
- **Other** — any evidence not covered above

Record what you find. Photograph what you can. The provenance is often the most interesting story the book has to tell.
