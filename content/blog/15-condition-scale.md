# The Bookseller's Condition Scale Is a Work of Fiction

*Fine, Near Fine, Very Good, Good — a guided tour through the grading system that the entire trade uses and nobody agrees on. Why one dealer's "Very Good" is another's "Good" and how to protect yourself.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

---

You are reading a dealer's catalog. The book is described as "Very Good." You have a picture in your mind: a clean copy, perhaps some minor wear to the extremities, maybe a touch of foxing to the endpapers, but essentially a book you'd be pleased to own. You order it. It arrives. It is not what you pictured.

The spine is sunned. The cloth is rubbed at the corners. There is a previous owner's inscription on the half-title, a coffee ring on the rear board, and a general air of having been read on public transport for several decades. It is, in the dealer's honest assessment, "Very Good." It is, in your honest assessment, something less. You are both right. This is the problem.

## The Scale

The condition grading system used in the anglophone antiquarian and secondhand book trade runs, from best to worst:

**As New** (or **Mint**): Indistinguishable from a copy that has just left the publisher. No marks, no wear, no signs of use. The book appears unread. This grade is rare for any book more than a few years old and genuinely exceptional for anything published before 1980. If a dealer describes a book from 1955 as "As New," they are either in possession of a miracle or in the grip of optimism.

**Fine** (F): A book with no defects. Not "no significant defects" — no defects at all. The binding is tight, the cloth or boards are bright, the dust jacket (if present) is complete and unfaded, the pages are clean. Fine does not mean perfect in the cosmic sense, but it means that a careful examination reveals nothing to criticise. In the real market, "Fine" is used more loosely than this definition suggests — which is, in a single sentence, the entire problem with the grading system.

**Near Fine** (NF): A book that falls just short of Fine — a single, minor flaw that prevents the higher grade. A tiny bump to one corner. A name on the flyleaf. The faintest suggestion of sunning to the spine. Near Fine implies that you need to look carefully to find the defect, and that when you find it, it is small. It is the grade of the almost-perfect copy, and when used honestly, it is the most useful grade on the scale.

**Very Good** (VG): Here the trouble begins. "Very Good" sounds like a compliment. It is not. In the condition scale, Very Good is the middle grade — it indicates a book with obvious wear but no serious damage. The binding is sound. The pages are clean or nearly so. But the book shows signs of use: rubbed extremities, a cocked spine, light foxing, a previous owner's bookplate, some fading. A Very Good book is a decent, honest, read copy that has been around. It is not a collector's copy in any competitive field, and it is emphatically not what the words "Very Good" suggest to a civilian.

This is the single greatest source of disappointment in the book trade. The buyer reads "Very Good" as praise. The seller means it as a technical grade indicating moderate wear. The gap between these two interpretations is where trust goes to die.

**Good**: A book that is complete and intact but shows significant wear. The binding may be shaken. The cloth may be stained or faded. There may be foxing, annotations, library stamps, or repairs. "Good" is the grade that says: this book has lived a full and eventful life, and it shows. In the used book trade, "Good" is honest and respectable. In the rare book trade, "Good" is a polite way of saying that the copy is unlikely to excite anyone except a scholar who needs the text.

**Fair**: The book is complete but in poor condition. Worn, stained, repaired, possibly lacking the dust jacket, possibly rebacked or rebound. Fair books are reading copies, reference copies, or placeholder copies held until a better one comes along. They have their uses. Investment potential is not among them.

**Poor**: The book exists. That is the most positive thing that can be said about it. Heavily worn, possibly incomplete, possibly held together by gravity and habit. A Poor book is acquired only if no better copy is available or if some specific feature — an inscription, a unique variant, a provenance mark — makes this particular wreck interesting despite its condition.

## The Continental Variations

The anglophone scale is not universal, and European dealers — particularly in France, Germany, and the Low Countries — use their own terminology, which maps imperfectly onto the English grades.

In the **French** trade, the standard descriptions run roughly: *état neuf* (as new), *très bon état* (very good condition), *bon état* (good condition), *état correct* or *état passable* (fair), *état médiocre* (poor). The nuances differ from the English system in important ways. French dealers tend to be more specific in their defect descriptions and less reliant on a single summary grade. A French catalog entry might read "*Bon état. Quelques rousseurs éparses. Dos légèrement insolé. Petite déchirure sans manque au faux-titre.*" — which tells you more about the book's actual condition than any single English grade ever could.

The **German** system uses *tadellos* or *vorzüglich* (fine/excellent), *sehr gut* (very good), *gut* (good), *befriedigend* (satisfactory), *mäßig* (fair). German dealers share the French tendency toward detailed defect descriptions, and the best German catalogs — from houses like Hartung & Hartung in Munich or Reiss & Sohn in Königstein — are models of precise, no-nonsense condition reporting. If a German catalog says *Einband berieben, Rücken mit kleiner Fehlstelle, sonst gut* (binding rubbed, spine with small loss, otherwise good), you know exactly what you're getting.

In the **Dutch** trade, *als nieuw* (as new), *zeer goed* (very good), *goed* (good), *redelijk* (fair) are standard, with condition notes in Dutch that tend toward the practically descriptive. Belgian dealers, operating in a market that straddles French and Dutch traditions, often provide bilingual descriptions or default to French for the international market.

The **Italian** system — *ottimo*, *molto buono*, *buono*, *discreto*, *mediocre* — follows a similar gradient, with the added complication that Italian dealers, particularly those handling Renaissance and Baroque material, often provide condition descriptions of exceptional technical detail, reflecting Italy's long tradition of bibliographic scholarship.

## Why Nobody Agrees

The condition scale is subjective by nature. It asks a human being to look at a physical object and assign it a grade from a short list of words, each of which covers an enormous range of actual conditions. The gap between a low Fine and a high Near Fine is a matter of judgment. The gap between a high Very Good and a low Very Good is a canyon.

Several factors make agreement impossible.

**Specialisation bias.** A dealer who handles fine press books and modern firsts in collector condition operates in a world where "Very Good" means "not good enough." A dealer who handles working copies of nineteenth-century scientific texts operates in a world where "Very Good" means "remarkably well preserved for a book that spent a century in a laboratory." Both are using the same words. They are not describing the same standard.

**Era adjustment.** What constitutes "Fine" for a book from 1510 is different from what constitutes "Fine" for a book from 1910. A sixteenth-century book in its original binding with only minor wear is extraordinary — a genuine survivor. The same level of wear on a book from a century ago is unremarkable. The grading system does not explicitly account for this, leaving the adjustment to the dealer's experience and the buyer's understanding.

**The jacket problem.** For twentieth-century books, the dust jacket is often graded separately from the book itself — "Book Fine, jacket Very Good" or "NF/VG" in the common shorthand. This doubles the complexity and doubles the scope for disagreement. A jacket with a single short tear at the crown: is that Near Fine or Very Good? Dealers disagree. Collectors disagree. The same dealer may disagree with themselves on different days.

**Cultural calibration.** Anglo-American dealers tend to grade higher than their Continental European counterparts — this is a broad generalisation, but it is widely acknowledged in the international trade. A book described as "Very Good" by a London dealer might be described as *bon état* with detailed defect notes by a Parisian dealer selling the same copy. Neither is wrong. They are using different systems with different calibrations, and the buyer who moves between them without adjusting expectations will be alternately delighted and dismayed.

## How to Protect Yourself

The condition scale is imperfect but not useless. It provides a shared vocabulary — roughly shared, approximately shared — that enables commerce at a distance. The following habits will reduce the gap between expectation and reality:

**Read the full description, not just the grade.** The grade is a summary. The description is the evidence. A book graded "Very Good" with a note reading "minor rubbing to extremities, small previous owner's stamp to front pastedown, otherwise bright and clean" is a very different proposition from one graded "Very Good" with no further comment. The absence of a detailed description is itself information, and it is not reassuring.

**Learn the dealer.** Grading is personal. Once you've bought from a dealer two or three times, you know their standard. A dealer whose "Very Good" consistently meets your expectations is a dealer to return to, regardless of whether their standard matches the theoretical definition. A dealer whose "Near Fine" consistently disappoints is a dealer to avoid, regardless of their reputation.

**Ask for photographs.** In the age of digital photography, there is no reason to buy a book of any significant value without seeing images. Front board, spine, rear board, dust jacket (front, spine, rear, flaps), title page, any defects mentioned in the description. A dealer who refuses to provide photographs is either hiding something or operating in a previous century. Neither is acceptable.

**Understand that condition is relative to the market.** A "Very Good" copy of a book that rarely appears on the market in any condition may be a perfectly sensible purchase. A "Very Good" copy of a book that regularly appears in Fine condition is a compromise that will cost you when you try to resell. The grade means nothing in isolation. It means everything in context.

**Buy the best you can afford.** This advice appears in every collecting guide ever written because it is correct. A Fine copy at a premium is, in the long run, cheaper than a Very Good copy at a bargain, because the Fine copy holds its value and the Very Good copy does not. The cheap copy is not a bargain. It is a permanent reminder that you could have spent more.

The condition scale is a work of fiction — a useful, necessary, deeply imperfect fiction. Learn to read it critically, and it will serve you well. Trust it blindly, and it will deliver parcels that disappoint you on a regular basis.

The book is always exactly as good as it is. The description is only ever an approximation.
