# Octavo, Quarto, Folio: A Field Guide to Book Sizes Nobody Asked For

*How the folding of a single sheet of paper determined the shape of Western literature — and why "large octavo" is not the same as "small quarto," no matter what your shelf suggests.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

There is a moment, early in every collector's education, when someone says "quarto" and you nod as though you know what it means. You have a general sense. It's a size. Bigger than most books. Smaller than the really big ones. Shakespeare published in quarto before the First Folio, so it must be important. Beyond that: fog.

This is not your fault. Book formats are taught badly when they're taught at all, and the terminology has been misused so thoroughly by publishers, booksellers, and catalog compilers that even the words themselves have drifted from their original meanings like continents from Pangaea. But the underlying system is both logical and beautiful, and once you understand it, you will see every book differently.

It all starts with a sheet of paper.

## One Sheet, Many Books

In the hand-press period — roughly 1450 to 1820, though the boundaries are fuzzy — a book was not printed page by page. It was printed *sheet by sheet*. A single large sheet of paper, dampened and laid on the press, received an impression of multiple pages at once, arranged so that when the sheet was folded, the pages fell into the correct reading order.

The format of a book is determined by how many times that sheet was folded.

**Folio** (2°): the sheet is folded once, producing two leaves (four pages). The resulting book is large — typically 30 cm or taller, depending on the size of the original sheet. Church books, atlases, legal texts, and works intended to impress. The Shakespeare First Folio of 1623 is a folio not because Shakespeare was important (the quartos came first) but because the publishers, Jaggard and Blount, wanted a prestige format for a collected edition. It worked. The book is enormous, commands a room, and currently fetches around $10 million at auction.

**Quarto** (4°): the sheet is folded twice, producing four leaves (eight pages). Roughly 23–28 cm tall. The standard format for plays, pamphlets, and works of moderate length in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Shakespeare's plays were first published individually as quartos — cheap, portable, and disposable, which is why so few survive. The difference in status between a Shakespeare quarto and the First Folio is the difference between a newspaper and a monument, expressed entirely through the folding of paper.

**Octavo** (8°): three folds, eight leaves, sixteen pages. Roughly 19–23 cm. The format that changed publishing. When Aldus Manutius began printing pocket-sized octavos in Venice around 1501 — the famous Aldine editions of the Greek and Latin classics — he essentially invented the portable book. Before Aldus, books were furniture. After Aldus, they were companions. The octavo is the ancestor of every paperback you've ever owned, and Aldus is the reason you can read on a train.

**Duodecimo** (12°): a more complex fold producing twelve leaves (twenty-four pages). Roughly 15–18 cm. Popular for devotional works, pocket dictionaries, almanacs, and anything intended to be carried rather than shelved. The Elzeviers in Leiden and Amsterdam made the duodecimo their signature format in the seventeenth century — their compact editions of classical texts, the *Republics* series, and their French-language literary editions were the pocket books of the Dutch Golden Age. The folding scheme is less intuitive than the others — it involves cutting before folding, or a combination of folds at right angles — and has generated more confusion among bibliographers than any other format. It is not a dessert, despite what the name suggests.

**Sextodecimo** (16°) and beyond: four folds, sixteen leaves. Small. Very small. The further you go — 18°, 24°, 32°, 48°, 64° — the smaller the book becomes and the more specialised the use case. A 64° is roughly the size of a postage stamp and exists primarily to prove that it can.

## The Catch: Sheet Size Is Not Standard

Here is where the elegance of the system meets the chaos of history.

The format tells you how the sheet was folded. It does not tell you how large the sheet was. And sheet sizes in the hand-press period were not standardised — they varied by mill, by country, by period, and by the specific papermaking mould in use. A sheet of *royal* paper (roughly 50 × 63 cm) produces a folio of one size. A sheet of *crown* paper (roughly 38 × 50 cm) produces a folio of a rather different size. An octavo cut from royal paper may be taller than a quarto cut from crown.

This is why "large octavo" and "small quarto" overlap in physical dimensions while remaining entirely different formats. A large octavo is a book printed eight-to-a-sheet on a large sheet. A small quarto is a book printed four-to-a-sheet on a small sheet. They may sit next to each other on your shelf at exactly the same height. They are not the same thing. The format describes the *construction*, not the *measurement*.

In Britain, the most common sheet sizes had names: pot, foolscap, crown, demy, medium, royal, super royal, imperial. Each had a nominal size, though actual sizes varied. On the Continent, the names were different, the sizes were different, and the variation was if anything greater. Italian paper from the mills around Fabriano — among the oldest in Europe, operating since the thirteenth century — came in sizes that bore no relation to the French *grand aigle* or *raisin* or *jésus* (yes, there was a paper size called *jésus*; it measured roughly 56 × 76 cm and was used for large-format printing). A Venetian folio and a Parisian folio from the same decade might differ in height by ten centimetres or more. The paper didn't care about your categories.

After the mechanisation of papermaking in the early nineteenth century, sheet sizes became more standardised, and the relationship between format and physical size grew more predictable. But by then, a new problem had arrived: publishers began using the format terms loosely, as approximate size descriptions rather than structural designations. A modern publisher who describes a book as "quarto" usually means "it's biggish" — roughly 25–30 cm — without any reference to how the sheets were actually folded and cut. This drives bibliographers to quiet despair, which they express through footnotes.

## How to Determine Format

If the format describes how a sheet was folded, and you're holding a bound book, how do you determine the format after the fact? The folds are hidden inside the binding. The sheet has been cut into individual leaves. The evidence, it would seem, has been destroyed.

Not quite. Several indicators survive.

**Chain lines and watermarks.** Handmade paper carries the impression of the mould it was made on: thin, closely spaced *laid lines* and thicker, more widely spaced *chain lines* (*pontuseaux* in French, *Kettlinien* in German). The orientation of the chain lines relative to the spine tells you how the sheet was folded. In a folio, chain lines run horizontally. In a quarto, they run vertically. In an octavo, they run horizontally again. This is because each fold rotates the chain line orientation by 90°. A watermark, if present, will appear in a predictable position depending on the format — roughly centred in a folio leaf, at the inner edge of a quarto leaf, and so on.

Hold a leaf up to the light. If you can see chain lines and a watermark, you have the two pieces of evidence you need to determine format. If you can't — because the paper is too thick, or machine-made, or the watermark has been trimmed away — you need other evidence.

**Conjugacy.** In a gathering (the group of leaves produced by folding a single sheet), certain leaves are physically attached to each other — they are *conjugate*. In a quarto gathering of four leaves, leaf 1 is conjugate with leaf 4, and leaf 2 is conjugate with leaf 3. You can sometimes verify this by gently opening the book at the centre of a gathering and checking which leaves share a continuous sheet. The pattern of conjugacy differs by format and is diagnostic.

**Signing and register.** Printers identified gatherings with a letter or number — the *signature* — printed at the foot of certain leaves. The pattern of signing often reveals the format. A quarto typically signs the first two leaves of each gathering (A, A2); an octavo signs the first four (A, A2, A3, A4). These are conventions, not laws, and exceptions abound, but the pattern is a useful starting point.

**Measurement.** As a last resort, you can estimate format from the height of the book, provided you have some idea of the sheet size. But this is the least reliable method, for all the reasons described above. Height alone cannot distinguish a large octavo from a small quarto, and any bibliographer who relies solely on measurement will eventually be embarrassed.

## Why Any of This Matters

You might reasonably ask why a collector needs to know any of this. The book is the size it is. It sits on the shelf it sits on. Who cares whether the printer folded the sheet three times or four?

The answer is that format is one of the primary ways in which editions and issues are identified and distinguished. The same text printed as a quarto and as an octavo in the same year constitutes two different editions — and they may differ in text, in completeness, in intended audience, and dramatically in value. The quarto Shakespeare plays and the First Folio contain different texts, edited differently, with different errors and different readings. Bibliographers have spent careers on these differences. Collectors have spent fortunes.

Format also tells you something about intention. A folio was expensive to produce and expensive to buy; it signals importance, permanence, authority. A quarto was cheaper and more accessible. An octavo was portable, popular, democratic. A duodecimo was intimate, personal, private. The choice of format was a statement — by the publisher, by the printer, sometimes by the author — about what kind of object the book was meant to be and who was meant to read it. When the States General of the Dutch Republic commissioned an official Bible translation in 1637 — the *Statenvertaling* — it appeared as a folio. Authority demanded it. The pocket duodecimos came later, for personal devotion.

Understanding format, in other words, is not pedantry. It is literacy. It is the ability to look at a book and see not just words on a page but a manufactured object with a production history written into its physical structure. The folds are still there, even if you can't see them. The sheet is still there, divided but not destroyed. The format is the book's skeleton, and like all skeletons, it determines the shape of everything built around it.

Next time someone says "quarto," you won't need to nod and hope. You'll know. And you'll probably also know that they're using the term incorrectly, which is a different kind of pleasure entirely.
