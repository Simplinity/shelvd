# The Book Fair Survival Guide

*How to navigate a rare book fair without losing your wallet, your composure, or an argument about points of issue. You will fail at least one of these.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

A rare book fair is a room full of people who know the price of everything and the value of considerably more. It is a marketplace, a social event, a competitive sport, and — for a certain kind of person — a religious experience. It is also the easiest place on earth to spend money you didn't intend to spend, on books you didn't know you wanted, from dealers who are better at this than you are.

This is a survival guide. It will not prevent you from buying too much. Nothing can prevent that. But it may help you buy too much more effectively.

## Before You Arrive

**Set a budget.** Write it down. Put the number on a piece of paper in your wallet, next to the money you are about to spend past it. The budget will not hold. It never holds. But having one at least creates a moment of hesitation — a microsecond of conscience between "that's beautiful" and the tap of a card — and that microsecond is all that stands between you and financial decisions you'll need to justify to a spouse, a bank manager, or yourself on the drive home.

**Know what you're looking for.** This sounds obvious. It is not. A book fair without a want list is a grocery shop without a shopping list: you will come home with fourteen things you didn't need and none of the things you did. A want list doesn't need to be elaborate — a short list of titles, authors, or subjects you're actively collecting, folded in your pocket, consulted between stands. It gives you direction. Direction is the enemy of impulse, and impulse is expensive.

**Research the dealers.** Major fairs publish exhibitor lists in advance. If there are dealers who specialise in your area, find their stands first. If there are dealers you've bought from before and trust, start there. The fair is large, your time is limited, and the best material moves quickly. The collector who arrives with a plan will leave with better books than the collector who wanders.

**Dress for endurance, not for style.** You will be on your feet for hours. The venue will be either too warm or too cold, never the right temperature. You will be carrying books, catalogs, and a bag that grows heavier with each stand. Comfortable shoes. A bag with a shoulder strap. Pockets for your phone, your wallet, and the business cards you'll accumulate. Leave the overcoat at the cloakroom. You'll need your hands free.

## The First Hour

At major fairs — the London International Antiquarian Book Fair, the New York Antiquarian Book Fair, SLAM in Paris, the Feria del Libro Antiguo in Madrid, the Stuttgart Antiquariatsmesse — there is often an **early entry** option: a preview hour or preview evening, available for an additional fee, before the fair opens to the general public. Pay it. The serious material — the books that dealers have been holding back for the fair, the items they know will sell within hours — is on the stands from the preview. By the time the general public arrives, the best things may already be gone, sold to collectors who understood that the price of early entry is the cheapest investment you'll make all day.

If there is no preview, arrive when the doors open. Not "around ten." Not "after coffee." When the doors open. The early hours of a book fair have a particular energy — a purposeful, slightly caffeinated urgency — and the collectors who arrive first have first choice. This is not a browsing activity. This is reconnaissance.

Walk the fair once, quickly, before you buy anything. Note the stands that interest you. Note the books that stop you. Note the prices. Do not buy on the first pass. The temptation is fierce — "if I don't buy it now, someone else will" — and sometimes the temptation is correct. But a first pass gives you an overview, lets you compare, and prevents the particular regret of buying a good copy on Stand 4 when a better copy was waiting on Stand 47.

The exception is a book you've been looking for, in the condition you want, at a price you can afford. If all three conditions are met, buy it. Do not walk away to "think about it." Thinking about it is how other people end up with your book.

## Talking to Dealers

Dealers at book fairs are not shop assistants. They are specialists, often with decades of experience in their field, and many of them are scholars in their own right. They know more about their stock than you do. This is not a threat — it is a resource.

**Ask questions.** A good dealer will tell you about a book's provenance, its bibliographic significance, its condition issues, and its place in the market. They are not doing this out of charity — a well-informed buyer is more likely to buy, and more likely to come back — but the information is genuine and often excellent. If a dealer says "the binding is recased" or "the half-title is supplied from another copy," they are disclosing condition information that a less scrupulous dealer might omit. Reward honesty with your attention and, when appropriate, your money.

**Don't pretend to know more than you do.** Dealers can spot a bluffer at fifteen paces, and they are unfailingly polite about it, which is somehow worse. If you don't know what a "point of issue" is, ask. If you're not sure whether the price is fair, say so. "I'm not sure about the price — can you tell me more about this copy?" is a perfectly respectable question and will get you a more useful answer than pretending to deliberate knowledgeably while frantically trying to look something up on your phone behind the bookcase.

**Negotiate with respect.** At a book fair, prices are often negotiable — but the negotiation has conventions. Asking "what's your best price?" is standard. Offering half the marked price is insulting. The margin on antiquarian books is not what non-dealers imagine: after rent, fair costs, travel, insurance, and the cost of stock (which may sit unsold for years), the profit on an individual sale is often thin. A discount of 10–15% is common between dealer and collector. More than that is a favour, not an entitlement.

If a dealer won't move on price, accept it gracefully. They may have reasons — the book is priced to market, another client is interested, the cost price was high — and pressing the point wins nothing except a reputation for being difficult. The antiquarian book world is small. Reputations persist. This is as true in Brussels as it is in London — perhaps more so, because the Flemish and Francophone dealer communities are small enough that everyone knows everyone.

## What to Look For (And Look Out For)

A book fair is the best place to handle books — to open them, examine them, assess condition in person rather than from a photograph. Use this opportunity.

**Check completeness.** Does the book have all its plates? (Count them against the list of illustrations, if there is one.) Is the half-title present? Is the errata leaf present? Is the map still in the pocket? Are the advertisement leaves at the rear present or removed? Incompleteness is the most common condition issue in antiquarian books and the one most frequently overlooked in the excitement of a fair.

**Check the binding.** Open the book carefully and look at the hinges (where the boards attach to the text block). Are they firm or starting? A "starting" hinge is one where the joint is beginning to crack — the book still opens, but the board moves with an ominous flexibility. Rebinding is expensive. A rebound book is worth less than one in a sound original binding, sometimes dramatically so. Look at the spine: is it original, or has it been relaid (a "reback")? Rub your thumb gently across the leather: does it feel firm, or does it leave a reddish-brown residue (red rot, the terminal condition of certain types of tanned leather)? These are things a photograph won't tell you.

**Check the dust jacket** if there is one. Is it original to the book, or a facsimile? (See our article on dust jackets for how to tell.) Is it price-clipped? Is the spine faded? Are there chips, tears, or stains? Is it protected by a Mylar wrapper? A jacket in a Mylar wrapper has been cared for. A jacket without one has been at the mercy of handling, light, and the friction of being pulled on and off a shelf.

**Check for restoration.** Restoration is not inherently bad — a professionally restored book may be more stable and more attractive than an unrestored one — but it should be disclosed and priced accordingly. Look for leaves that are a slightly different shade of white (washed or bleached), for repairs along the inner margins (where torn leaves have been mended), for boards that feel suspiciously even (recovered or repaired). Under ultraviolet light, many repairs fluoresce differently from the original materials. You probably don't carry a UV torch to book fairs. Consider starting.

## The Economics of the Fair

A book fair is, among other things, a market — and markets have dynamics that reward the informed.

**Prices at fairs are generally firm but not fixed.** Dealers have priced their stock for the fair, often with care, and the prices reflect their assessment of the market. But dealers also want to sell — they've paid for a stand, travelled to the fair, and are competing for attention with fifty other stands. On the first day, there is less room to negotiate because the material is fresh and the audience is large. On the last day, there is more room, because unsold stock must be packed and shipped home.

**Condition drives value.** Two copies of the same book at the same fair may be priced 500% apart because one is in fine condition and the other is in good condition. The collector who understands condition — who can distinguish "very good" from "near fine" and knows what the distinction means in monetary terms — will consistently buy better and spend less than the collector who shops on title alone.

**Buy the best copy you can afford.** This is the oldest advice in collecting and the most frequently ignored. A fine copy at a high price is almost always a better investment than a poor copy at a low price, because fine copies are scarce and their scarcity increases over time. Poor copies are common, remain common, and do not appreciate. The cheap copy is not a bargain. It is a placeholder — and placeholders have a way of becoming permanent.

**Keep receipts.** Every receipt from every dealer. They are your provenance record, your proof of purchase, your insurance documentation, and your evidence if a book turns out to be other than described. File them. You will be grateful later. You will be extremely grateful if you ever need to make an insurance claim, because your insurer will ask for them and your memory of what you paid for what in 2019 will turn out to be considerably less reliable than you assumed.

## The Ride Home

You will spend more than you intended. This is certain. The budget you set before you left — the one you wrote on a piece of paper and put in your wallet — is now a historical document, a record of optimism rather than constraint. You will think about this on the drive home, with a stack of books on the back seat that was not there this morning.

You will feel two things simultaneously: the pleasure of acquisition and the anxiety of expenditure. These feelings will coexist peacefully until you get home, at which point one of them will be joined by a third: the need to explain.

The explanation is simple. You went to a book fair. You bought books. The books are good. They are better than the books you would have bought online, because you held them, examined them, spoke to the dealers, and made informed decisions. The money is spent. The books will last. The fair was worth it.

And next year, you'll set a budget again.
