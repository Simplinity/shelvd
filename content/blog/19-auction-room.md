# The Auction Room: A Beginner's Guide to Not Panicking

*How book auctions actually work — estimates, reserves, buyer's premium, paddle bidding, absentee bids, online bidding. The unwritten rules, the common mistakes, and why the hammer price is not the price you pay.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

The first time you attend a book auction, you will be afraid of two things: that you will accidentally buy something by scratching your nose, and that everyone else in the room knows what they're doing. The first fear is unfounded — auctioneers are professionals, not snipers, and they can tell the difference between a bid and an itch. The second fear is entirely justified.

Book auctions have their own customs, their own vocabulary, and their own unwritten rules, accumulated over centuries of practice. Sotheby's has been selling books since 1744 — the firm was founded *as* a book auctioneer, and the first sale, on 11 March 1744, dispersed the library of Sir John Stanley, Bt. Christie's followed in 1766. Drouot in Paris dates from 1852. Dorotheum in Vienna from 1707. Bubb Kuyper in Haarlem from 1977. The tradition is old, the conventions are entrenched, and the newcomer who walks in without understanding them will pay — sometimes literally — for the education.

This is the education, without the cost.

## Before the Sale

**The catalog.** Every auction is preceded by a catalog — printed, digital, or both — listing the lots in the order they will be sold. Each lot description includes: the author and title, a bibliographic description (edition, format, pagination, binding), a condition note (of varying detail), an estimate (the auction house's expectation of what the lot will sell for), and sometimes a provenance summary or literature reference.

The estimate is a range — "£800–1,200" or "€2,000–3,000" — and it is, roughly, the house's informed guess at the hammer price. Estimates are not guarantees. They are not starting prices. They are predictions, and like all predictions, they are sometimes wrong. An estimate is most useful as a guide to the house's assessment of the lot's market position. A low estimate on a desirable lot may indicate competitive bidding ahead. A high estimate may indicate that the consignor has ambitious expectations. In both cases, do your own research.

**The viewing.** Before every sale, the lots are available for inspection — typically for two or three days preceding the auction. This is not optional. You should attend the viewing with the same seriousness that you would bring to inspecting a house before buying it. The catalog description is a summary. The book is the reality. Condition issues that are not mentioned in the catalog will be visible in person. Condition issues that *are* mentioned may be better or worse than you imagined.

At major houses — Christie's in London, Sotheby's, Ketterer Kunst in Munich, Pierre Bergé in Paris (now Drouot) — the viewing rooms are staffed by specialists who can answer questions, provide additional information, and show you lots from the case. Ask. They are there to help, and their knowledge is frequently exceptional. At smaller houses, you may be handling the lots yourself, in which case: clean hands, gentle touch, and no coffee near the books.

**The reserve.** Most lots have a reserve — a minimum price below which the lot will not sell. The reserve is confidential (it is not published in the catalog) but is typically set at or near the low estimate. If bidding does not reach the reserve, the lot is "bought in" — it fails to sell, is returned to the consignor, and may reappear at a future sale. A lot that is bought in is not a bargain you missed. It is a lot that nobody wanted at the price.

## How the Bidding Works

**Paddle bidding (in the room).** If you attend in person, you register before the sale and receive a numbered paddle. When you wish to bid, you raise your paddle. The auctioneer acknowledges your bid and calls for the next increment. You keep bidding until you win or stop. When you stop, lower your paddle clearly. The auctioneer will move on.

The bidding increments follow a standard scale, which varies slightly by house but is broadly consistent:

- Up to £500: increments of £20–£50
- £500–£1,000: increments of £50
- £1,000–£2,000: increments of £100
- £2,000–£5,000: increments of £200
- £5,000–£10,000: increments of £500
- Above £10,000: increments of £1,000

The auctioneer may adjust these at their discretion — splitting an increment to keep two bidders engaged, or skipping an increment to accelerate a lot that is clearly going higher. The auctioneer is conducting, not merely recording, and the rhythm is part of the performance.

**Absentee bids (on the book).** If you cannot attend, you can leave a written bid — a maximum amount you are willing to pay — with the auction house before the sale. The house will bid on your behalf, using the standard increments, up to your maximum. If no one bids higher, you win at one increment above the next-highest bid — not at your maximum. If two absentee bids are identical, the one received first takes precedence.

Absentee bids are the safest method for the nervous beginner: you set your limit in advance, in the calm of your study, without the adrenaline of the room. The disadvantage is inflexibility — if the bidding approaches your maximum and you would, in the room, have gone one increment higher, the absentee bid cannot adapt.

**Telephone bidding.** For higher-value lots, most houses offer telephone bidding. A member of staff calls you during the lot, relays the bidding in real time, and places your bids on your instruction. This combines the flexibility of room bidding with the comfort of distance. It requires pre-registration and is usually available only for lots above a certain estimate — the house allocates staff to each phone bidder, and the resource is finite.

**Online bidding.** Increasingly the dominant method. Major houses offer live online bidding through their own platforms or through aggregators like Invaluable, the-saleroom.com, or Drouot Live. You watch the sale in real time (video or audio, depending on the platform), and bid with a click. The interface introduces a slight delay — half a second to a second — which can matter in fast-moving lots but is generally manageable. Online bidding usually incurs an additional surcharge (typically 3–5% of the hammer price), on top of the standard buyer's premium.

## The Price You Actually Pay

The hammer price — the price at which the auctioneer's hammer falls — is not the price you pay. On top of the hammer price, you will be charged:

**Buyer's premium.** A percentage of the hammer price, charged by the auction house to the buyer. The rate varies by house and by price band but is typically 20–28% on the first tranche (say, the first £500,000), reducing to 15% and then 12% on higher amounts. Some smaller houses charge a flat 20%. The premium is non-negotiable and is added to the hammer price automatically.

**VAT or sales tax.** In Europe, VAT may apply to the buyer's premium (always) and sometimes to the hammer price (depending on the lot's VAT status and the seller's circumstances). The catalog will indicate the VAT status of each lot with symbols that you should learn to read. In Belgium and the Netherlands, the margin scheme (*margeregeling*) often applies to secondhand goods including books, meaning VAT is charged only on the auction house's margin (the premium), not on the hammer price.

**Online surcharge.** If you bid online through a third-party platform, the surcharge (3–5%) is added on top of everything else.

**Shipping and insurance.** If you're not collecting in person, the house will ship the lot to you — or, more commonly, connect you with a specialist shipper. Books are heavy. International shipping is not cheap. Insurance in transit is essential.

The practical result is that a lot with a hammer price of €1,000 will cost you, by the time you've paid premium, VAT on premium, and shipping, somewhere between €1,250 and €1,450. This is a 25–45% uplift on the hammer price. Factor it into your bidding, or your budget will betray you.

## The Unwritten Rules

**Set your limit before the lot is called.** Decide, before the auctioneer opens bidding, the maximum hammer price you will pay. Write it down. Stick to it. The room, the rhythm, the competitive charge of bidding — these are designed, whether intentionally or by centuries of refinement, to make you spend more than you planned. Your limit, written on the margin of your catalog in pencil before the adrenaline started, is the only reliable defence.

**Don't bid on the first call.** When the auctioneer opens a lot — "Lot 247, the Elzevir Virgil, I have an opening bid of €800, who'll give me €900?" — the opening bid is often an absentee bid or a house bid (a bid placed on behalf of the consignor, up to the reserve). There is no advantage to being the first live bidder. Let the opening bids establish the level, then enter when you're ready. This is not gamesmanship; it is simply patience.

**Watch the room.** At a viewing, observe which collectors are examining which lots. At the sale, observe who is bidding on what. The antiquarian book world is small, and the major collectors and dealers are known to each other. If a prominent dealer in sixteenth-century Italian books is bidding aggressively on a lot you also want, you are facing someone with deep knowledge and, probably, a client waiting. This doesn't mean you should surrender — it means you should have done your homework on value before entering that particular contest.

**Don't chase.** If bidding on a lot exceeds your limit, stop. Lower your paddle. Do not tell yourself "just one more increment." The lot you lose today will appear again — the same copy at a future sale, or a comparable copy from a different source. There is always another book. There is not always more money.

**Pay promptly.** Most houses require payment within seven to thirty days of the sale. Late payment may incur charges and will certainly damage your standing with the house. A good relationship with an auction house — prompt payment, clear communication, consistent bidding — is worth cultivating. It may, over time, earn you early notice of consignments, access to private sales, and the indefinable but real advantage of being a known and trusted buyer.

## Where to Start

If you've never attended a book auction, the following sequence is recommended:

First, attend a viewing without buying. Walk through the lots. Handle the books. Read the catalog descriptions and compare them to what you see. Get a feel for the room, the staff, the range of material.

Second, attend a sale without buying. Sit in the back. Watch how the bidding works. Note the pace, the increments, the auctioneer's patter. Observe who bids, how they bid, and when they stop. You will learn more in two hours of watching than in any guide, including this one.

Third, bid on something small. Pick a lot with a low estimate — €100–€300 — in a field you know. Set your limit. Bid. Win or lose, you will have broken the seal, and the next time will be easier.

The auction room is not a hostile environment. It is a marketplace, with rules and conventions like any other. The professionals who populate it — the auctioneers, the dealers, the institutional buyers — are generally courteous to newcomers, because every regular was once a newcomer, and the trade depends on a constant supply of new collectors with money and enthusiasm.

Bring both. Leave the nervousness at the door. And remember: the hammer price is never the price you pay.
