# Why Old Books Smell Like That

*The chemistry of bibliosmy — vanilla, almonds, grass, and what your nose is actually detecting when you open a book from 1890.*

You know the smell. Everyone who has ever walked into an antiquarian bookshop, a university library, or a grandmother's study knows the smell. It is warm, slightly sweet, vaguely spicy, and almost universally pleasant. It is the reason people bury their noses in old books — an act that, in any other context, would be considered eccentric but in the book world is understood as a form of connoisseurship.

The smell has a name. In 2012, a team of researchers at UCL coined the term **bibliosmy** — from the Greek *biblion* (book) and *osmē* (smell) — to describe the characteristic odour of old books. They also analysed it. Because this is what scientists do: they take something beautiful and decompose it into volatile organic compounds. And the results are, if anything, more interesting than the romance.

## What You're Actually Smelling

Old book smell is not one scent. It is a cocktail of hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), released by the slow chemical degradation of the materials that make up a book: paper, binding adhesives, inks, and sizing. The specific blend depends on the age of the book, the composition of its materials, and the conditions in which it has been stored. But several compounds dominate, and they are recognisable.

**Vanillin.** The same compound that gives vanilla its flavour. It is produced by the breakdown of lignin — the structural polymer in wood-pulp paper. As lignin degrades (through oxidation and acid hydrolysis), it releases vanillin and related compounds, giving the paper a sweet, warm, slightly caramel undertone. This is why wood-pulp books from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries often have the strongest "old book smell": they contain the most lignin, and the lignin has been degrading the longest.

Books printed on rag paper — which contains little or no lignin — produce significantly less vanillin. This is one reason why a fifteenth-century incunabulum smells different from a Victorian novel: the chemistry of the paper is fundamentally different, and so is the bouquet.

**Benzaldehyde.** An almond-scented compound, produced by the oxidation of certain organic compounds in paper and binding materials. If you detect a faintly nutty, marzipan-like note in an old book, this is the likely source.

**Furfural.** A compound with a grassy, hay-like aroma, produced by the degradation of cellulose (the primary structural component of all paper). Furfural production increases with temperature and humidity, which is why books stored in warm, damp conditions often develop a stronger smell — they are degrading faster. A conservator at the Institut national du patrimoine in Paris once told me that you can estimate a book's storage history from its furfural content. She was not joking.

**Ethanol and other alcohols.** The slightly sharp, solvent-like note in some old book smells comes from low-molecular-weight alcohols produced by the breakdown of cellulose and sizing materials. These are more prominent in books that have been stored in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces — which, unfortunately, describes most bookshelves.

**Acetic acid.** The vinegar note. Present in small quantities in most old books, more prominent in books with acidic paper. If a book smells distinctly of vinegar, the paper is actively degrading — the acid content is high and producing acetic acid as a byproduct. This is not a pleasant patina. It is a warning.

**Toluene and ethylbenzene.** Aromatic hydrocarbons associated with certain inks and binding adhesives. These are more common in twentieth-century books, where synthetic materials were used more widely. They contribute a faintly sweet, chemical undertone that is distinct from the organic warmth of lignin degradation.

## The Science Gets Serious

The UCL study — led by Matija Strlič, a chemist specialising in heritage science — did something clever. They placed historic paper samples in sealed containers, allowed the VOCs to accumulate, then analysed the headspace using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. They identified over a hundred individual compounds and mapped their relative concentrations.

More usefully, they tested whether the VOC profile could be used diagnostically — as a non-invasive tool for assessing the condition of paper. The answer was yes. The concentration of certain compounds (particularly furfural and acetic acid) correlates with the degree of paper degradation. A book that smells strongly of vanilla and grass is releasing vanillin and furfural at rates that indicate active lignin and cellulose breakdown. The smell, in other words, is not just pleasant. It is data.

This has practical applications. The concept of **sniffing out** a book's condition is not metaphorical — trained conservators can and do use smell as a diagnostic tool. A musty, damp smell indicates mould or water damage. A sharp, acidic smell indicates advanced acid degradation. A sweet, warm smell indicates lignin breakdown, which is expected in wood-pulp paper but concerning if it appears in a book that should be on rag stock.

The Institut royal du Patrimoine artistique (KIK-IRPA) in Brussels and the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung in Berlin have both explored VOC analysis as a conservation screening tool — a way to identify at-risk books in large collections without physically examining each one. The idea is simple: sample the air in a sealed bookshelf or storage box, analyse the VOC profile, and flag books whose chemical signatures indicate rapid degradation. It is, in effect, a smoke detector for paper.

## New Books Smell Too (But Differently)

New book smell is a different phenomenon entirely. It comes not from degradation but from manufacture: the solvents in printing inks, the adhesives used in binding, the chemical treatments applied to paper during production. The "new car smell" of a freshly printed book is a cocktail of isopropyl alcohol, toluene, acetone, and various acrylates and vinyl compounds from the binding process.

It is, objectively, a chemical exposure. It is also, subjectively, delightful. The human talent for enjoying the smell of things that are technically not good for us is well documented and extends comfortably from petrol stations to bookshops.

The new book smell fades as the solvents evaporate — typically within weeks to months, depending on ventilation. What replaces it, over years and decades, is the beginning of the old book smell: the slow, invisible chemistry of paper ageing, releasing its compounds one molecule at a time into the air around it.

## The Smell as Information

For the collector, the smell of a book is free information. Not precise information — you cannot determine a book's date or provenance by sniffing it — but useful information about its materials, its storage history, and its current state.

A book that smells of **warm vanilla and old wood**: probably wood-pulp paper, nineteenth or twentieth century, in stable condition. The lignin is degrading normally.

A book that smells of **almost nothing**: likely rag paper, well stored. The absence of smell is, in this context, a good sign — it means minimal chemical degradation.

A book that smells of **damp earth or mushrooms**: mould, either active or recently inactive. Investigate. Isolate the book from the rest of the collection until you've confirmed the mould is dead.

A book that smells of **sharp vinegar**: acid degradation, possibly advanced. The paper is likely brittle. Handle with care.

A book that smells of **cigarette smoke**: a previous owner smoked. The smell is absorbed into the paper and is extremely difficult to remove. Airing helps. Activated charcoal in a sealed container helps more. Complete removal may not be possible without professional treatment. This is one of the few forms of book damage that is entirely the fault of the previous owner and has nothing to do with the materials or the maker.

## The Pleasure of It

Science explains what old books smell like. It does not fully explain why we *enjoy* the smell. The compounds involved — vanillin, benzaldehyde, furfural — are present in foods and fragrances that humans find pleasant (vanilla, almonds, fresh-cut hay). There may be a simple hedonic explanation: old book smell happens to activate the same olfactory receptors as things we already like.

But there is probably more to it. Smell is the sense most directly connected to memory and emotion — the olfactory bulb connects to the hippocampus and amygdala without the intermediary processing that other senses require. The smell of old books may trigger not just recognition but association: childhood libraries, grandparents' studies, the particular quiet of a room full of books, the feeling of absorption and safety that reading provides.

A perfumer in Grasse would call this an *accord* — a combination of notes that produces an effect greater than the sum of its parts. The vanilla from the lignin, the almond from the benzaldehyde, the grass from the furfural, the faint sharpness of the acids — together, they produce something that smells like knowledge, or memory, or the passage of time made pleasant.

Your books are talking to you through the air. The least you can do is listen.
