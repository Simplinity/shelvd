# First Edition, First Printing, First State: A Glossary of Expensive Distinctions

*The terminology that separates a reading copy from a retirement fund — and why collectors argue about half-title pages with the intensity of medieval theologians debating the Trinity.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

No term in book collecting causes more confusion, more argument, and more expensive mistakes than "first edition." It is used by publishers, booksellers, collectors, and auction houses, and they all mean slightly different things by it. The result is a terminology that functions less like a shared language and more like a dialect map — intelligible within each community, treacherous at the borders.

This is an attempt to draw the map.

## First Edition

In publishing, "first edition" means the entire first setting of type — every copy printed from that typesetting, whether it's a thousand copies or fifty thousand, whether they were printed in one run or ten. A publisher who prints 5,000 copies in March and another 5,000 from the same plates in September will call both "first edition." The March copies are the first printing (or first impression). The September copies are the second printing. Both are first edition.

In collecting, "first edition" almost always means first edition, first printing — the very first copies off the press. This is what matters for value, and it is where most of the money lives. When a dealer lists a book as "first edition" without further qualification, they mean first printing. When a publisher stamps "First Edition" on the copyright page of a book that has been reprinted fourteen times with the same plates, they mean something broader and considerably less valuable.

The confusion is structural and permanent. Publishers and collectors use the same words to mean different things, and neither group shows any inclination to change. The collector's only defence is to ignore what the book calls itself and look at the evidence.

## How to Identify a First Printing

Every publisher has its own method of indicating print runs, and these methods have changed over time, which means that identifying a first printing is less a single skill than a library of publisher-specific knowledge accumulated over years. Some general patterns:

**The number line.** Modern publishers (roughly 1970 onward) typically print a sequence of numbers on the copyright page: `10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1`. The lowest number present indicates the printing. If the `1` is present, it's a first printing. For the second printing, the `1` is removed: `10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2`. Simple, elegant, and adopted universally only after decades of publishers inventing their own incompatible systems.

Some publishers count down from a different starting point, or arrange the numbers differently, or use letters instead of numbers. Random House for many years printed `First Edition` on the copyright page and removed the words for subsequent printings — but only sometimes, and not consistently across all imprints. Knopf added `FIRST EDITION` above the number line. Scribner's used an `A` on the copyright page. Cape used `First published [year]` without any further indication — leaving the collector to determine from other evidence whether the copy in hand is the first printing or the twenty-first.

On the Continent, practices vary further. Gallimard's *édition originale* is identified by the phrase "Il a été tiré de l'édition originale de cet ouvrage..." followed by a limitation statement specifying the number of copies on various paper grades — *vélin pur fil*, *alfa*, *papier ordinaire*. The presence of this *justification de tirage* is the primary identifier of a first printing. Later printings (*nouveaux tirages*) bear a different colophon. For German publishers, the *Erstausgabe* is usually identified by a combination of the copyright page statement and the printer's mark (*Druckvermerk*); Suhrkamp and Fischer have their own conventions.

**The statement.** Many publishers, particularly British ones, print "First published [year]" or "First edition [year]" on the copyright page. Subsequent printings are indicated by additional lines: "Reprinted 1963, 1965, 1971." If the only statement is "First published 1962" with no reprint lines, it's either a first printing or a publisher who forgot to update the page. Both happen.

**Price on jacket.** For twentieth-century books, the price printed on the dust jacket flap can help distinguish printings. If the first printing was priced at 12s 6d and the jacket on your copy reads 15s, you have a later jacket on a first-printing book (possibly) or a later printing with an updated jacket (more likely). Cross-referencing the jacket price with published bibliographies is standard practice and occasionally thrilling in a way that is difficult to explain to non-collectors.

**Bindings and cloth.** First printings sometimes differ from later printings in binding cloth colour, board texture, or endpaper design. These differences are usually documented in bibliographies for major authors. The first printing of *The Catcher in the Rye* (1951) has a black cloth binding with the author's photograph on the rear panel of the jacket. The Book-of-the-Month Club edition — which is not a first printing and is worth a fraction of the price — has a slightly different binding and no photograph. The differences are subtle. The price difference is not.

## First Printing vs. First Issue vs. First State

Here is where the terminology becomes genuinely technical, and where the arguments start.

A **first printing** is the first press run — all copies printed before the press was stopped and the type was altered or the plates were corrected. Within a first printing, there may be variations, because errors were sometimes corrected during the print run without stopping the press. The copies printed before the correction are **first state** (or **first issue**, depending on which bibliographic tradition you follow and how much you enjoy arguments).

The distinction between "state" and "issue" has generated more bibliographic debate than almost any other terminological question, and the definitions vary by authority. The most widely accepted framework, following Fredson Bowers' *Principles of Bibliographical Description* (1949), defines them roughly as follows:

A **state** is a variation within a single issue — a textual correction, a cancel leaf, a change made during the print run without any change to the book's publication or distribution status. The corrected and uncorrected copies were sold simultaneously, mixed together, indistinguishable to the original buyer.

An **issue** is a variation that involves a deliberate change in the way the book is presented to the market — a new title page, a different binding, a change of publisher's name, the addition of errata. An issue implies a *publishing decision*, not just a printing correction.

In practice, the distinction is not always clear, and bibliographers routinely disagree about whether a specific variant constitutes a new state or a new issue. These disagreements are conducted in footnotes, in journal articles, and at conference panels attended by twelve people, all of whom have strong opinions. The rest of the world does not notice, but for the twelve people in the room, the stakes feel genuinely high.

## Points of Issue

The specific features that distinguish a first printing, first state, or first issue from later ones are called **points** (or **points of issue**). They are the fingerprints of a first edition, and for collectible books, they are memorised, debated, and checked with the forensic attention of a detective examining a crime scene.

Some famous examples:

**The Great Gatsby** (1925, Scribner's). First printing identified by: "chatter" on page 60, line 16 (later corrected to "echolalia"); "northern" on page 119, line 22 (later corrected to "southern"); "sick in tired" on page 205, lines 9–10 (later corrected to "sickantired"). These are typographical errors in the first printing that Fitzgerald corrected for the second. Their presence *confirms* the first printing. Their absence *disqualifies* it. An error, in this context, is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

**The Sun Also Rises** (1926, Scribner's). First printing, first state identified by: "stoppped" (three p's) on page 181, line 26. Corrected in the second state to "stopped." One superfluous letter. The difference in value: approximately $50,000.

**Casino Royale** (1953, Cape). First printing identified by: the text on the copyright page reading "first published 1953" with no reprint lines; the jacket priced at 10s 6d (later printings: 12s 6d, 15s); and the author's name on the front board in a specific typeface. The boards are black. The jacket has a heart design extending across front and rear panels. The first impression was approximately 4,750 copies. Current market value in fine condition with jacket: £50,000–£100,000.

**Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone** (1997, Bloomsbury). First printing identified by: the number line reading `10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1`; the author listed as "Joanne Rowling" on the copyright page (later changed to "J.K. Rowling"); "1 wand" listed twice in the equipment list on page 53; and the imprint page listing "Thomas Taylor" as the jacket illustrator. The first printing was 500 copies, 300 of which went to libraries. A fine copy with jacket — of which perhaps a dozen survive — currently sells for £60,000–£80,000 at auction, though prices have exceeded £100,000 for exceptional copies.

**Le Petit Prince** (1943, Reynal & Hitchcock, New York). The first edition is American, not French — Saint-Exupéry was in exile. First printing identified by the Reynal & Hitchcock imprint (later editions carry the Gallimard name after the rights reverted) and the specific dust jacket with watercolour illustrations by the author. The first French edition (Gallimard, 1946) is a separate publication and a separate collecting point. The distinction matters enormously and is a source of perpetual confusion.

## The Bibliographic Record

For any collectible author, there exists (or should exist) a **bibliography** — a detailed, systematic description of every edition, printing, issue, and state of their works. These are the reference works that collectors and dealers consult to identify points of issue, distinguish first printings from later ones, and resolve disputes.

The great author bibliographies are monuments of scholarship: Matthew Bruccoli on Fitzgerald and Hemingway, B.C. Bloomfield and Edward Mendelson on Auden, Donald Gallup on Eliot and Pound, Richard William Lindner on Waugh. On the Continent: the *Bibliographie des œuvres de Voltaire* by Bengesco, the Carteret for French illustrated books, Rahir and Tchemerzine for French literature. They describe each book's physical construction in meticulous detail — collation, pagination, binding, jacket, typography — and record every known variant.

For less collected authors, or for books outside the Anglo-American literary tradition, bibliographic coverage is thinner, and the collector must rely on a combination of general references (*Book Collecting: A Modern Guide*, edited by Jean Peters; John Carter and Nicolas Barker's *ABC for Book Collectors*), online databases (the Bibliographical Society's resources, ViaLibri, OCLC), and the accumulated knowledge of specialist dealers.

Carter and Barker's *ABC for Book Collectors*, first published in 1952 and now in its ninth edition, deserves particular mention. It is the standard glossary of the trade — concise, authoritative, dry as a bone, and indispensable. If you collect books and don't own a copy, you are operating without a dictionary. Rectify this immediately.

## Why the Distinctions Matter

A cynic might ask: why does a typographical error make a book worth $400,000? Why does one superfluous "p" add $50,000 to the price? The text is the same. The reading experience is identical. The error is, by definition, a mistake.

The answer is scarcity, not aesthetics. The first printing is the first physical manifestation of a text — the moment when a literary work stopped being a manuscript and became a published book. The first state, with its uncorrected errors, represents the earliest possible form of that manifestation. There are fewer first-state copies than second-state copies, because the error was caught and corrected during the press run. The earlier the state, the scarcer the survival, the higher the price.

But there is also something less rational at work. The errors matter because they are evidence of process — of a book being made, in real time, by real people who occasionally misread copy or transposed letters. The "chatter" on page 60 of *Gatsby* is a window into the Scribner's composing room in 1925: someone set the wrong word, someone missed it in proofing, Fitzgerald caught it later and corrected it. The error is human, specific, and unrepeatable. It connects the collector to the moment of creation in a way that a corrected text cannot.

This is, perhaps, the deepest appeal of first editions: not the text, which is available in any printing, but the object — the specific, physical, imperfect artifact that records a particular moment in the history of publishing. The typo is the proof that it was there first.

Which is either profound or absurd, depending on whether you're the one holding the book.
