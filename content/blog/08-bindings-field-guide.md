# Vellum, Calf, Morocco, Cloth: A Field Guide to Book Bindings

*The materials that cover books, from medieval to modern — how to identify them by sight and touch, and why the choice of covering tells you as much about the book as the text inside.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

---

A book's binding is its armour, its wardrobe, and its autobiography. It tells you when the book was bound, for whom, with what intent, and by what traditions. A sixteenth-century limp vellum wrapper tells a different story from an eighteenth-century full calf with gilt spine, which tells a different story from a Victorian publisher's cloth, which tells a different story from a modern paperback's perfect binding. The covering material is not decoration. It is evidence.

And yet most collectors, when they begin, cannot tell calf from morocco by touch, have never heard of "tree calf," and would not know a *reliure janséniste* from a *reliure à la fanfare* if both fell on their foot. This is understandable. Nobody teaches this. You learn it by handling books — thousands of books, over years — and by knowing what to look for.

Here is what to look for.

## Vellum and Parchment

The oldest covering material for Western books. Vellum is prepared animal skin — typically calf, though the term is used loosely. Parchment (from goat or sheep) is technically distinct but often used interchangeably. Both are made by soaking the skin in lime, scraping it clean of hair and flesh, stretching it on a frame, and drying it under tension. The result is a translucent, remarkably strong material that has been used for writing and binding since late antiquity.

Vellum bindings come in several forms. **Limp vellum** — boards of flexible vellum without stiff backing — was the standard utilitarian binding of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly in Italy, Spain, and the Germanic lands. It is recognisable instantly: pale, slightly yellowed, often with manuscript titling on the spine in brown ink, the covers curling inward or outward depending on humidity. Limp vellum is tough, functional, and handsome in a monastic sort of way. It was the jeans of early modern bookbinding — workwear, not fashion.

**Stiff vellum over boards** — vellum stretched over pasteboard or wooden boards — appears in grander bindings, often tooled in gold or blind. The *reliures en vélin* of seventeenth-century France and the Low Countries can be magnificent: white vellum with gilt compartments on the spine, gilt arms on the covers, red-sprinkled edges. The Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague and the Bibliothèque Mazarine in Paris hold spectacular examples.

Vellum has one enemy: moisture. In damp conditions, vellum warps, cockles, and develops a clammy texture. In very damp conditions, it becomes a substrate for mould. Keep vellum-bound books in stable, cool, dry conditions, and they will outlast almost anything. Subject them to the climate of a Belgian cellar, and they will reproach you visibly.

## Leather: Calf, Morocco, Sheep, Pigskin

Leather has been the prestige binding material in the West since the late Middle Ages. But "leather" is not one material — it is a family of materials, differing in animal source, tanning method, and finish, and the differences matter enormously for both appearance and durability.

**Calf** (*veau* in French, *Kalbleder* in German) is the most common leather used in European bookbinding from the sixteenth century through the nineteenth. It is tanned from the skin of young cattle and produces a smooth, fine-grained surface that takes tooling well. Calf can be left plain (showing the natural grain), stained and polished to a uniform colour, or treated with acid to produce decorative patterns.

The most celebrated of these treatments is **tree calf** — a marbled pattern resembling the bare branches of a winter tree, produced by applying acid (typically copperas, or iron sulphate) to the dampened covers in a controlled drip. The acid reacts with the tannins in the leather, creating dark branching patterns against a lighter ground. Tree calf was fashionable from the late eighteenth century through the early nineteenth, particularly in Britain, and a well-executed example is genuinely beautiful — if you can get past the fact that it was made by deliberately pouring acid on leather.

The problem with calf is **red rot** — a form of chemical deterioration in which the leather loses its structural integrity and turns to a fine, reddish-brown powder. Red rot is caused by the breakdown of the tanning agents (particularly the sulphuric acid used in some tanning processes) and is accelerated by atmospheric pollution, particularly sulphur dioxide. Rub your thumb across a calf binding and look at your thumb: if it comes away red, the leather is rotting. This is not reversible. It can be slowed — by applying leather dressings or by storing the book in a pollution-free environment — but the damage already done is permanent.

Red rot is so common in calf bindings from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that it has become almost expected. This does not make it acceptable. It makes it a tragedy.

**Morocco** is goatskin leather, tanned using vegetable tannins (typically sumac), and named after Morocco, which was historically a major source. It is the luxury binding material par excellence — finer-grained than calf, more durable, more resistant to red rot, and capable of taking the most elaborate gold tooling.

Full morocco bindings, particularly those from the great French *ateliers de reliure* — Trautz-Bauzonnet, Chambolle-Duru, Marius Michel, and later Rose Adler and Paul Bonet — are objects of applied art. A *reliure mosaïquée* by Marius Michel, with inlaid panels of different-coloured moroccos forming a geometric or floral design, is as far from a utilitarian binding as a couture gown is from a raincoat. The French tradition of fine binding (*reliure d'art*) is a continuous lineage from the sixteenth century to the present, and it is one of the great underappreciated art forms of European culture. The *Bibliothèque littéraire Jacques Doucet* in Paris and the *Bibliotheca Wittockiana* in Brussels (one of the few museums in the world dedicated entirely to bookbinding) are the places to see it.

**Half morocco** — morocco on the spine and corners, with paper or cloth on the boards — is a common compromise: the spine gets the durable, beautiful material; the boards get something cheaper. It is respectable, practical, and omnipresent in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century libraries.

**Sheep** is the budget leather. Softer, looser-grained, and less durable than calf or morocco, it was used for cheaper bindings and working copies. It darkens with handling, cracks easily, and rarely ages gracefully. If you pick up a leather-bound book and the surface feels slightly greasy, spongy, or worn to an indeterminate brown, it is probably sheep.

**Pigskin** (*Schweinsleder*) is a Germanic speciality — tough, distinctive, with visible hair follicle patterns (three dots in a triangular arrangement). Used extensively in German and Central European binding from the late Middle Ages through the eighteenth century, often over wooden boards, blind-tooled with roll stamps showing biblical or allegorical scenes. A pigskin binding from a Bavarian monastery is unmistakable: heavy, white or cream-coloured, built to survive apocalyptic weather conditions and possibly the Apocalypse itself.

## Cloth

The arrival of cloth as a binding material in the 1820s was the most significant change in bookbinding since the adoption of pasteboard. It was driven by economics: the steam-powered printing press had made books cheap to produce, and leather bindings were now the bottleneck. Publishers needed a covering material that was cheap, fast to apply, and presentable. Cloth — cotton fabric coated with starch or pyroxylin to give it body and resistance to dirt — was the answer.

The first publisher's cloth bindings appeared in the late 1820s, and by the 1840s, cloth had become the standard covering for trade editions. The cloth was dyed in a range of colours (red, blue, green, brown, purple), embossed with decorative patterns (called "grains"), and stamped with the title and any decorative elements using brass dies and, increasingly, gold foil.

Publisher's cloth bindings are collectible in their own right. The elaborate gilt-stamped covers of the 1850s–1890s — the "gift book" era — are spectacular examples of Victorian graphic design. The restrained elegance of early Faber and Faber cloth (designed under the influence of the Bauhaus) is the polar opposite. The bright, rough-textured Buckram used by the Nonesuch Press, the distinctive orange cloth of Penguin first editions, the dark blue of the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade — each publisher's cloth tells you something about the book's origins, its market, and its moment.

For the collector, the condition of the cloth matters. Fading (particularly on spines exposed to light), bumping and fraying at corners, staining, and — most disfiguringly — foxing of the cloth itself all affect value. A "bright, unfaded" cloth binding is worth significantly more than a "faded and rubbed" one, and the descriptive vocabulary for cloth condition is as specific as for any other material.

## Modern Bindings: Paper, Board, and Perfect Binding

The twentieth century introduced the **paperback** — first as a European phenomenon (Tauchnitz in Germany from 1837, Reclam's *Universal-Bibliothek* from 1867, Albatross in 1932, and most famously Penguin in 1935), then as a global format. Paper covers over a perfect-bound (adhesive-bound) text block: cheap, light, disposable.

Perfect binding — in which the pages are held together by a strip of adhesive rather than by sewing — is efficient and inexpensive. It is also, in many cases, impermanent. The adhesive can become brittle with age, causing pages to detach. If you have ever opened a paperback and had the spine crack and pages fall out, you have experienced the limitations of perfect binding in real time.

Hardcover trade books today are typically bound in **paper-covered boards** — thick cardboard covered with a printed paper wrapper, sometimes with a cloth spine strip for durability. The dust jacket sits over this. The binding itself is rarely of intrinsic interest, which is a relatively new development — for most of the history of bookbinding, the covering was a significant part of the book's identity and value.

## What the Binding Tells You

Every binding is a decision. A decision about materials, about aesthetics, about cost, about the intended life of the book. A fifteenth-century book bound in oak boards and pigskin was meant to last centuries, and it has. A nineteenth-century *édition de luxe* in full morocco *doublé* (with leather-lined inner covers) was meant to be a treasure, and it is. A mass-market paperback was meant to last one reading, and often doesn't.

When you pick up a book, the binding is the first thing you touch. Learn to read it. The material under your fingers is part of the story.
