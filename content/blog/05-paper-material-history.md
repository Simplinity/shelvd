# Paper: A Material History in Five Chapters

*From Chinese mulberry bark to modern acid-free stock — five turning points that changed what books are made of, how they age, and which ones will survive.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

Every book is, before it is anything else, a piece of paper. Or several hundred pieces of paper, folded and sewn and trimmed and bound, but paper nonetheless. The text is what you read. The paper is what you hold. And the history of paper is, in a very real sense, the history of what books *are* — their weight, their texture, their colour, their smell, their durability, and their ultimate fate.

That history has five turning points. Each one changed the physical nature of the book so fundamentally that a collector who understands them can pick up a volume, feel the paper between thumb and forefinger, and place it within a century — sometimes within a decade — without reading a word.

## Bark, Bamboo, and the Chinese Invention

Paper was invented in China. The traditional date is 105 AD, credited to Cai Lun, a eunuch official at the Han court, though archaeological evidence suggests that crude paper was being made from hemp fibres at least two centuries earlier. Cai Lun's contribution was probably not invention but industrialisation — he standardised the process and promoted its use for official documents, replacing the bamboo strips and silk scrolls that had served Chinese writing for millennia.

The method was simple in principle and extraordinarily difficult in practice: plant fibres (mulberry bark, hemp, rags, bamboo, rice straw) were soaked, beaten to a pulp, suspended in water, and lifted on a flat screen mould. The water drained through the screen; the fibres settled into a thin, interlocked mat; the mat was pressed, dried, and became paper.

For six centuries, papermaking remained a Chinese monopoly. The technology spread slowly along the Silk Road — to Korea by the sixth century, to Japan by the seventh (where *washi*, made from the bark of the *kōzo* mulberry, became one of the most refined papers ever produced and remains so today — Japanese tissue is still the material of choice for book conservation worldwide). The crucial westward transmission came, according to tradition, after the Battle of Talas in 751 AD, when Arab forces defeated a Chinese army in present-day Kyrgyzstan and captured papermakers among the prisoners. Within decades, paper mills appeared in Samarkand, then Baghdad, then Damascus, then Cairo.

The Arab contribution was not merely transmissive. Papermakers in the Islamic world refined the process significantly, introducing linen rags as a fibre source (producing a stronger, smoother sheet than mulberry bark), developing new sizing methods using starch, and establishing the large-scale mills that would eventually supply paper to European markets. The paper of medieval Islamic manuscripts — smooth, cream-coloured, remarkably durable — is a testament to this refinement. Some of it has survived a thousand years in better condition than European paper half its age.

## Rags and Water Mills — Paper Comes to Europe

Paper arrived in Europe through the Islamic territories of Spain and Sicily. The oldest known European paper document is a deed of King Roger II of Sicily, dated 1109, written on paper of Arab manufacture. The earliest European paper mills appeared in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries — Xàtiva in Spain (mentioned by the geographer al-Idrisi in 1150), Fabriano in Italy (documented from the 1260s), and gradually spreading northward: Troyes and Essonne in France by the fourteenth century, Nuremberg by 1390, the Low Countries by the fifteenth century.

Fabriano deserves particular attention, because the Italian papermakers introduced three innovations that transformed the craft. First, the **stamping mill** — using water-powered wooden hammers to beat rags to pulp, replacing the slow, laborious process of hand-beating. This was not a refinement; it was an industrial revolution in miniature, and it multiplied output by orders of magnitude. Second, **animal-gelatine sizing** — coating the finished sheet with a solution of animal hide glue, which made the paper more resistant to ink penetration and gave it the smooth, slightly glossy surface that distinguished European paper from its Asian predecessors. Third, the **watermark** — a wire design attached to the mould that left a translucent impression in the sheet, identifying the mill, the papermaker, and sometimes the paper size or quality.

Watermarks are, for the book historian, a gift. They are datable, locatable, and catalogable. Charles-Moïse Briquet's *Les Filigranes* (1907) — a monumental catalog of nearly 16,000 watermarks from European paper mills between 1282 and 1600 — remains the standard reference, supplemented by the Piccard collection in Stuttgart (over 92,000 watermarks, searchable online at *wasserzeichen-online.de*) and various national databases. If you can identify a watermark, you can often determine where and when the paper was made, which in turn helps date and localise the book. A watermark is a fingerprint — the paper's, not the printer's — and reading it is one of the fundamental skills of analytical bibliography.

European paper in the hand-press period was made almost exclusively from **linen and cotton rags**. The supply chain was remarkable: old clothes, worn sheets, discarded sailcloth — anything made of linen or cotton — was collected by rag merchants (*chiffonniers* in France, *voddenrapers* in the Low Countries), sorted by quality, and sold to paper mills. The rags were cut, soaked, fermented (a process called *retting* that broke down the plant gums), beaten to pulp, and formed into sheets. The resulting paper was strong, flexible, naturally pH-neutral, and — this is the crucial point — extraordinarily durable.

A book printed on rag paper in 1470 is, in many cases, in better physical condition today than a book printed on wood-pulp paper in 1870. The paper is supple, white or cream-coloured, and structurally sound. It has lasted 550 years and will, if stored properly, last several hundred more. This is not an accident. It is chemistry.

## The Wood Pulp Revolution (And Its Consequences)

By the early nineteenth century, the demand for paper was outstripping the supply of rags. The Enlightenment had created a reading public. The Industrial Revolution had created mass literacy. Newspapers, journals, pamphlets, novels, textbooks — the appetite for printed material was growing exponentially, and the rag supply, which depended on a finite quantity of old clothing, could not keep up.

The solution came from two directions. In 1799, Louis-Nicolas Robert, a clerk at the Didot paper mill in Essonnes, south of Paris, invented the first machine for producing continuous sheets of paper — the predecessor of the Fourdrinier machine that would industrialise papermaking. And in the 1840s, Friedrich Gottlob Keller in Saxony and Charles Fenerty in Nova Scotia independently discovered that wood could be ground into a pulp suitable for papermaking.

Wood pulp paper was a miracle of economics. Wood was abundant, cheap, and required no collection network. A single tree could produce more paper than a mountain of rags. By the 1870s, wood-pulp paper had largely replaced rag paper for newspapers and everyday printing. By 1900, it dominated book publishing as well.

It was also a time bomb.

Wood contains **lignin** — a complex organic polymer that gives trees their structural rigidity. Lignin is an excellent building material for trees. It is a terrible component of paper. In the presence of light and oxygen, lignin breaks down into acidic compounds that attack the cellulose fibres that give paper its strength. The paper becomes brittle, darkens to a tobacco brown, and eventually crumbles to fragments at a touch.

This is not a slow process in bibliographic terms. A rag paper book from 1500 can be in beautiful condition after five centuries. A wood-pulp paper book from 1890 can be falling apart after barely a hundred years. The famous "brittle books" crisis that alarmed librarians in the 1980s was a direct consequence: surveys estimated that a third or more of the books in major research libraries were too fragile to be handled — not because they were ancient, but because they were printed on self-destructing paper.

The irony is bitter. The books from the period of greatest literary and scientific output — the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries — are physically the most fragile. Dickens, Tolstoy, Zola, Freud, Darwin in later editions — their words survive in the text, but the original objects are disintegrating. Meanwhile, a Gutenberg Bible sits in the Morgan Library, its paper as sound as the day it was printed, because Johannes Gutenberg used rag paper and lignin had not yet been invited to the party.

## The Chemists Intervene — Sizing and Acidity

The lignin problem was compounded by another, subtler disaster: **alum-rosin sizing**.

Sizing is the coating applied to paper to control its absorbency — without sizing, paper acts like a blotter, and ink spreads uncontrollably. In the hand-press period, sizing was animal gelatine: pH-neutral, stable, and harmless to the paper. When machine papermaking arrived, gelatine sizing was too slow for continuous production. In 1807, Moritz Friedrich Illig, a German chemist, developed a sizing method using rosin (pine resin) precipitated with alum (aluminium sulphate). It was fast, cheap, and effective. It was also acidic.

Alum-rosin sizing produces sulphuric acid as a byproduct — slowly, continuously, and irreversibly. Combined with the acid generated by lignin degradation, it created a double assault on paper chemistry. Books printed between roughly 1850 and 1990 are, in many cases, being attacked from two directions simultaneously: acid from the lignin within the fibres and acid from the sizing on the surface.

The library community's response was mass **deacidification** — industrial-scale chemical treatment to neutralise the acid and deposit an alkaline buffer (typically magnesium or calcium carbonate) in the paper to absorb future acid. Several systems were developed: the Wei T'o process (using magnesium methoxy compounds), the DEZ process (diethyl zinc gas — effective but alarmingly flammable), and the Battelle process used by the Deutsche Bücherei in Leipzig. The results have been mixed — deacidification slows deterioration but cannot reverse damage already done, and the treatments are expensive enough that only the most significant collections receive them.

## Acid-Free and Beyond — The Modern Era

The publishing industry's conversion to **acid-free paper** began in the 1980s, driven by librarians, archivists, and the slowly dawning realisation that books printed on acidic paper had a limited lifespan.

Acid-free paper is made with alkaline sizing (typically alkyl ketene dimer or alkenyl succinic anhydride) instead of alum-rosin, and often includes a calcium carbonate filler that acts as a built-in alkaline buffer. The paper is pH-neutral or slightly alkaline (pH 7.0–8.5) and is expected to last several centuries under normal storage conditions.

The international standard for permanent paper — ISO 9706, adopted in 1994 — specifies minimum requirements for pH, alkaline reserve, tear resistance, and oxidation resistance. Books printed on paper meeting this standard bear the infinity symbol ∞ on the copyright page, sometimes accompanied by the text "Printed on acid-free paper" or "Gedruckt auf säurefreiem Papier" or "Imprimé sur papier permanent." If you collect modern first editions, this small symbol is worth looking for. It is the publisher's promise that the paper was made to last — a promise that the publishers of the previous century were unable to make, because they didn't know they needed to.

Today, most trade publishers in Europe and North America use acid-free paper for hardcover books. Paperbacks and mass-market editions are less consistent — cost pressures remain, and the assumption (sometimes correct) is that a paperback is not expected to survive a century. But the general trend is clear: the era of self-destroying paper is ending.

For the collector, the practical implications are straightforward. Books printed before roughly 1850 are generally on rag paper: chemically stable, physically durable, likely to survive. Books printed between 1850 and 1990 are in the danger zone: wood-pulp paper, possibly acidic sizing, prone to browning and brittleness. Books printed after 1990 on acid-free stock should be fine for the foreseeable future.

The feel of the paper will often tell you more than the copyright page. Rag paper has a softness, a flexibility, a faint texture under the fingers that no machine-made paper quite reproduces. Acidic paper feels brittle, sometimes crackly at the edges, and darkens visibly toward the margins. Acid-free modern paper is smooth, white, and neutral — pleasant but anonymous, like a well-run hotel.

The best paper, though, is still the oldest. Pick up a book printed in Venice in 1495 on paper from a Fabriano mill, and feel the sheet between your thumb and forefinger. It is supple, strong, faintly cream-coloured. It has outlasted empires. It will outlast you. And it was made from someone's old shirt.
