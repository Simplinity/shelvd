# Why Your Bookshelf Is Lying to You

*On the uncomfortable gap between what you think you own and what you actually own — and why the uncataloged collection is a fiction you tell yourself.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

You know your collection. Of course you do. You bought every book in it. You carried them home, one by one, in bags that cut into your fingers on the walk from the shop. You shelved them with care, or at least with intent. You can picture the spines. You could find any title in minutes. Probably.

Except you can't, and you know you can't, and the proof is the book you bought last month that you already owned. Not a similar edition — the same edition. Same publisher, same year, same binding. You stood in a bookshop, held it in your hands, thought "I don't think I have this," and you were wrong. It's the third time this year. You don't talk about it.

This is not a character flaw. This is the natural condition of any collection above a certain size, and the threshold is lower than anyone admits. The human brain is not a catalog. It is a narrative engine that remembers feelings, contexts, and vague spatial impressions — "the blue one, second shelf, near the window" — and confuses this for systematic knowledge. It is not systematic knowledge. It is an anecdote with delusions of grandeur.

## The Inventory Illusion

There is a well-documented cognitive bias called the *illusion of explanatory depth* — the tendency to believe you understand a system better than you actually do. It applies to politics, to how toilets work, and, with devastating precision, to book collections.

Ask a collector how many books they own. The answer will be a round number — "about a thousand," "maybe three thousand," "somewhere around five hundred." These are not estimates. They are feelings expressed as numbers. The actual count, when someone finally does it, is invariably different — sometimes by 20%, sometimes by 50%, occasionally by a factor of two. The collector with "about a thousand" books may own six hundred or sixteen hundred, and they will be equally surprised by either.

The discrepancy grows with the collection. At fifty books, you know what you have. At five hundred, you think you know. At five thousand, you are operating on a combination of memory, hope, and spatial heuristics ("that shelf is mostly nineteenth-century French, so if I own it, it's there"). At twenty thousand, you are not so much managing a collection as cohabiting with one.

The books you forget are not random. They follow patterns. Books shelved out of their expected location — because the expected location was full, or because you were in a hurry, or because you shelved it sideways on top of a row — vanish from mental inventory almost immediately. Books in storage, in boxes, in the spare room, in the office, in that stack by the bed that has been "temporary" since 2017 — these are the dark matter of your collection. They exist. They have mass. They influence the shape of things. You cannot see them.

Double purchases are the symptom. The disease is the gap between what you believe about your collection and what is actually true. Your bookshelf is not lying to you, exactly. It's just not telling you the whole truth.

## What You Don't Know About What You Own

The quantity problem is embarrassing but manageable. The metadata problem is worse.

You know the titles. Mostly. You know the authors. Usually. Do you know which edition you have? Do you know whether it's a first printing? Do you know if the dust jacket is a later state? Do you know whether the book is complete — whether the errata slip is present, whether the map is still folded into the rear pocket, whether the half-title (that blank-looking leaf before the title page that doesn't seem to do anything) is there or was removed by a previous owner who didn't see the point?

Most collectors, if they are honest, know the answers for their best books and are guessing for the rest. The first edition of *À la recherche du temps perdu* that you acquired lot by lot over a decade — yes, you know the Grasset from the Gallimard, you know which volumes are *édition originale* on *papier ordinaire* and which are the later tirages. But what about the other 4,999 books? What about the ones you inherited from an uncle in Ghent, or bought in bulk at a *vide-grenier* outside Toulouse, or acquired from a dealer's bargain shelf without looking too closely? What about the ones you've owned so long that you've forgotten how they arrived?

The condition of your books is changing while you're not looking. Paper foxes. Cloth fades. Dust jackets yellow. Leather dries out, and if it dries out enough, it turns to a fine red powder that leaves your shelves looking like a crime scene — the dreaded *poussière rouge* that conservators at the Bibliothèque nationale spend their careers fighting. Bookworm damage can progress for years before it's noticed — the larvae work from the inside out, and by the time you see exit holes, the interior may look like a mining operation. None of this is happening dramatically. All of it is happening.

## The Things That Move

Books migrate. This is not a metaphor. In any collection above a few hundred volumes, books change location without your intervention or consent. A visitor picks one up, looks at it, puts it back in the wrong place. A cleaner shifts a stack to dust behind it. A child — or an adult, in a moment of decorative ambition — rearranges a shelf by colour. You yourself move a book to your desk to consult it, and it sits there for six months before being reshelved, if it's reshelved at all.

In institutional libraries, this problem is solved by a system of fixed locations: every book has an assigned shelf position, recorded in the catalog, and is returned to that position after use. The Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague, the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna, your local *médiathèque* — they all manage this with barcode systems and trained staff. In private collections, this system exists only in the collector's imagination, and it works exactly as well as that suggests.

The result is a slow, entropic drift. Books migrate from their intended locations to wherever they happen to end up. Over years, the orderly arrangement you established — by subject, by period, by language, by size — degrades into a palimpsest of overlapping systems, none of them complete, each one a geological layer representing a different organisational philosophy you held at a different period of your life.

You will, at some point, find a book shelved in a location that makes no sense by any system you have ever used. You will stare at it. You will have no memory of putting it there. It will remain a mystery. This is normal.

## The Case for Cataloging (Which You Already Know)

None of this is a surprise to you. You know your collection is imperfectly documented. You know there are gaps, duplicates, and books you've forgotten you own. You know the condition of some volumes is deteriorating in ways you haven't assessed. You know all of this, and you still haven't cataloged it, because cataloging is a large, slow, unglamorous task that competes for time with the considerably more enjoyable activity of buying more books.

This is the collector's dilemma: the act of acquisition is exciting, and the act of documentation is not, and so the collection grows faster than the catalog. The gap widens. The bookshelf lies more. The duplicate purchases continue. I've watched this pattern in my own collection — growing past ten thousand, past twenty thousand — and the moment I finally sat down with a spreadsheet was not a moment of virtue but of surrender. The spreadsheet broke, eventually, but that's another story.

There is no trick to solving this, no shortcut that makes cataloging as thrilling as finding a first edition in a charity shop or stumbling on a *Pléiade* you didn't know existed at a *brocante* in Namur. But there is a shift in perspective that helps: cataloging is not bureaucracy. It is *knowing what you have*. It is the difference between owning a collection and merely storing one. A cataloged collection is a tool — searchable, sortable, exportable, insurable. An uncataloged collection is a heap with ambitions.

Your books deserve to be known, not just owned. Your shelves deserve to be legible, not just full. And you deserve to stop buying books you already have, if only because the money would be better spent on books you don't.

Start with the shelf nearest to you. One book at a time. The bookshelf will stop lying to you when you finally ask it the right questions.
