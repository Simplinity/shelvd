# The Colophon: Reading the Page Nobody Reads

*That little block of text at the back of the book that tells you who printed it, where, when, and sometimes why — and how to decode it.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

---

Turn to the last page of a book printed before 1550 and you will find, more often than not, a short paragraph in Latin (or Italian, or German, or French) that tells you everything the title page doesn't — because there is no title page. The colophon is the original metadata: the printer's signature, the date, the place, and occasionally a statement of pride, exhaustion, or religious gratitude so personal that it feels like eavesdropping across five centuries.

"Impressum Venetiis per Aldi Romani mense Iunio M.ID." — Printed in Venice by Aldus Romanus in the month of June 1499. Twelve words. Place, printer, date. Everything you need to catalog the book. Everything the ISBN was invented to replace, except that the colophon did it first, did it in Latin, and asked for nothing in return but that you read it.

Almost nobody reads it.

## What a Colophon Is

The word comes from the Greek *kolophōn* — a summit or finishing touch. In bibliographic usage, it refers to a statement at the end of a book (or occasionally at the end of a section) that provides information about its production: who printed it, where, when, and sometimes for whom, with what typeface, on what paper, in what edition size.

In the manuscript tradition, colophons were written by scribes — often exhausted scribes. Medieval manuscript colophons are a genre of micro-literature in their own right: "The end. Thanks be to God. The scribe's hand is cold." "Now I have finished, give me a drink." "This book was written by Brother Antonius, whose hand is now so cramped he cannot hold the pen." These are not bibliographic data. They are human voices, unfiltered, reaching across a thousand years of silence.

In printed books, the colophon served a more formal function. From the earliest days of printing through the first decades of the sixteenth century — before the title page became standard — the colophon was the primary (often the only) source of publication information. Gutenberg's *Catholicon* of 1460 has a colophon that announces the new technology with undisguised pride: printed "without any reed, stylus, or pen, but by the wondrous concord, proportion, and measure of punches and type." Not bad for an advertisement.

## How to Read One

A colophon from the incunabular period (before 1501) typically follows a pattern:

> Explicit liber [title] impressus [city] per [printer] anno domini [date].

"Here ends the book [title], printed in [city] by [printer] in the year of our Lord [date]."

But the variations are enormous. Some colophons are terse: just a name, a place, a year. Others are expansive, providing the name of the commissioner (*ad instantiam* or *impensis* followed by a name — "at the instance of" or "at the expense of"), the precise date (sometimes to the day), the typeface or its designer, and occasionally a statement about the quality of the edition or the difficulty of the work.

The colophon of the Nuremberg Chronicle (*Liber Chronicarum*, 1493) is a masterclass in self-promotion: it names not only the printers (Anton Koberger) but the authors (Hartmann Schedel), the artists (Michael Wolgemut and Wilhelm Pleydenwurff), and the financiers (Sebald Schreyer and Sebastian Kammermeister). It is, in effect, a credits page — five hundred years before cinema invented the concept.

Some colophons contain information found nowhere else. The colophon of the Mainz Psalter (1457) — printed by Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, Gutenberg's former business partners — is the first printed book to name its printers, its date, and its place of production. It is also the first to use two-colour printing and the first to bear a printer's mark. Three firsts in one colophon. The Psalter knows it is important, and its colophon says so.

## The Colophon Gives Way to the Title Page

The title page — that familiar opening page bearing the title, author, publisher, and date — was not a feature of the earliest printed books. It emerged gradually in the late fifteenth century, initially as a simple half-title or label title, then evolving into the elaborate architectural and pictorial title pages of the sixteenth century.

As the title page grew, the colophon shrank. By the mid-sixteenth century, most of the information that had been in the colophon — printer, place, date — had migrated to the title page. The colophon became redundant for standard publication data and was dropped from most trade books.

But it didn't disappear entirely. It survived in two contexts.

First, in **private press and fine printing**. The great private presses of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries revived the colophon as a deliberate archaism — a nod to the hand-press tradition, a statement that this book was made with care. The Kelmscott Press, the Doves Press, the Ashendene Press, the Officina Bodoni in Verona, the Cranach Presse in Weimar — all used colophons, often beautifully set in the press's proprietary typeface, to record the details of production: paper, type, edition size, printer.

A Doves Press colophon, set in the famous Doves Roman and printed in red and black, is a thing of beauty. It tells you that the book was printed at No. 1, The Terrace, Hammersmith, on paper made at Joseph Batchelor's mill in Kent, in an edition of (say) 300 copies on paper and 25 on vellum. Every detail is precise, every choice is deliberate, and the colophon is the proof.

Second, in **limited editions and *livres d'artiste***. The colophon in a limited edition serves as a *justification de tirage* — a statement of the edition's composition. "This edition consists of 150 copies on *vélin de Rives*, numbered 1 to 150, and 20 copies on *japon impérial*, numbered I to XX." It may include the signatures of the author, the illustrator, and the printer. It may record the name of the typesetter. For the French *livre d'artiste* tradition — Vollard, Kahnweiler, Tériade, Maeght — the colophon is an essential component of the book's identity, and its absence or damage affects value.

## The Modern Colophon

In contemporary trade publishing, the colophon's information has been absorbed into the **copyright page** (also called the imprint page or title verso). This is the page that faces the title page and bears the publisher's name, the copyright statement, the ISBN, the edition statement, the printer's name (sometimes), and — if you're lucky — the paper specification.

Some publishers still include a proper colophon at the end of the book — particularly in well-designed editions. It might read: "This book was set in Garamond Premier Pro by Palimpsest Book Production, Falkirk, and printed and bound by Clays Ltd, Bungay, Suffolk." Or: "Gezet uit de Garamond door *Tekstbureau Goud*, Antwerpen. Gedrukt op zuurvrij papier door *Drukkerij Lannoo*, Tielt." This is the colophon in its minimal, modern form: a technical note, a credit to the craftspeople, a small assertion that the physical form of the book matters.

In fine press printing, the tradition continues unbroken. A colophon from a press like the Officina Bodoni, or the Barbarian Press, or the Whittington Press, or the Belgian *Druksel* press is not an afterthought. It is a statement of identity — a printer's mark as personal as a signature and considerably more informative.

## Why You Should Read It

The colophon is the most underread page in any old book. It is also, frequently, the most informative. It tells you what the title page doesn't: who actually made the physical object you're holding. In a period where title pages were often shared between multiple publishers (the colophon specifying which printer actually produced which edition), or where false imprints were used to evade censorship (a book printed in Amsterdam claiming to be from "Cologne" or "Pierre Marteau" — a fictitious publisher used as cover for clandestine editions across Europe), the colophon can be the only honest page in the book.

For incunabula without title pages, the colophon is not just useful — it is essential. Without it, you have no printer, no place, no date, and the book must be identified by other means (typeface analysis, paper analysis, contextual evidence) — all of which are more difficult and less certain.

Read the colophon. It is the printer's voice, speaking directly to you from across the centuries. It is the first metadata. And unlike its digital successors, it was typeset by hand, in lead, by someone who cared enough to sign their work.
