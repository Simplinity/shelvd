# Ex Libris: A Short History of Marking Books as Yours

*From medieval chain marks through armorial bookplates to rubber stamps and Dymo labels. The 600-year history of humans writing their names in books, and what your method says about you.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

---

The impulse is ancient and apparently irresistible: you acquire a book, and you write your name in it. Not because anyone is likely to steal it — though they might — but because the act of marking transforms the object. A book on a dealer's table belongs to no one. A book with your name in it belongs to you. The mark is the claim. The claim is the point.

Humans have been doing this for at least six centuries, and the methods they've chosen form a surprisingly revealing history of taste, technology, social aspiration, and the eternal tension between the desire to possess and the knowledge that possession, in the case of books, is always temporary.

## The Institutional Origins

The earliest ownership marks on books are institutional, not personal. Medieval monastic libraries — the primary custodians of written knowledge in Western Europe from the sixth century to the fifteenth — identified their books in several ways, all of them practical and none of them decorative.

**Inscriptions** were the simplest: a statement of ownership written on a flyleaf or the first page, often in Latin. "*Liber Sanctae Mariae de Melk*" (This book belongs to the Abbey of Melk). "*Hic liber est Sancti Bavonis Gandavensis*" (This book belongs to St Bavo's in Ghent). The formula varied, but the function was constant: this book has a home, and if you're reading this somewhere else, it should be returned.

**Chain marks** are the physical evidence of a more aggressive form of ownership protection. In medieval and early modern libraries, books were literally chained to the reading desks — a metal chain attached to the binding (usually the front or rear board), running to a rod along the desk. The practice was widespread from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century and survived in some libraries considerably longer: the chained library at Hereford Cathedral, largely intact, dates from the seventeenth century and remains one of the most atmospheric rooms in English bibliography. The chain attachment left characteristic marks on the binding — a metal staple, a hole, a worn patch on the board — that are visible centuries after the chain was removed. These marks are provenance evidence of a particularly direct kind: this book was once considered valuable enough to bolt down.

**Shelf marks and pressmarks** — alphanumeric codes indicating a book's position in a library — appear on flyleaves, spines, and pastedowns from the medieval period onward. They are the ancestors of the modern library call number, and they survive even when the library that assigned them does not. A shelf mark can identify a specific collection, a specific room, sometimes a specific shelf, and matching one to a historical catalog can place a book in an institutional context with remarkable precision. The Bollandists in Antwerp, the Maurists in Paris, the Benedictines at Monte Cassino — their shelf marks are still legible in books scattered across the world's collections.

## The Rise of the Bookplate

The personal bookplate — *ex libris* in the Latin that gives the form its name — emerged in the late fifteenth century, almost simultaneously with the printed book itself. The earliest known dated bookplate belongs to Hilprand Brandenburg of Biberach, a German cleric, and dates from 1480: a woodcut of a hedgehog carrying a flower, with the owner's name. It is charming, specific, and — like all the best bookplates — more revealing of its owner's personality than any biography.

Bookplates proliferated across Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, developing distinct national traditions. **German bookplates** (*Exlibris*) tended toward the heraldic and the elaborate, reflecting the Holy Roman Empire's complex system of armorial bearings. Albrecht Dürer designed bookplates; so did Lucas Cranach the Elder. The tradition of artist-designed *Exlibris* continued in the German-speaking world into the twentieth century, producing some of the finest small-scale graphic art in European history. The Deutsche Exlibris-Gesellschaft, founded in 1891, continues to document and promote the form.

**French bookplates** developed along similar heraldic lines but with a characteristically French attention to typographic elegance. The great libraries of the *noblesse de robe* — the legal aristocracy of the Ancien Régime — produced bookplates of extraordinary refinement: engraved coats of arms surrounded by elaborate mantling, with the owner's name and titles in a carefully chosen typeface below. After the Revolution, many of these bookplates became historical evidence of a vanished social order — the books survived; the families, in some cases, did not.

**Dutch and Flemish bookplates** reflect a different social reality. In a republic of merchants rather than an empire of nobles, bookplates were more often typographic than heraldic, identifying the owner by name and profession rather than by arms. The great collectors of the Dutch Golden Age — men like Gijsbert Cuper, Marquis de Vaucel, or Adriaan Pauw — used bookplates, but the tradition was less ostentatious than its French or German equivalent. When arms appeared, they were often those of a city or institution rather than a family.

**British bookplates** became a collecting mania in their own right during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Bookplate Society (founded 1891) and Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks — whose collection at the British Museum grew to over 200,000 examples — established bookplate studies as a minor but devoted field of antiquarian scholarship. Franks' catalog remains a standard reference: a bookplate identified as "Franks *4892" can be traced to a specific owner, a specific engraver, and a specific period.

## The Heraldic Bookplate and How to Read It

Armorial bookplates — those bearing a coat of arms — are the most informative for provenance research, because heraldic arms changed with the owner's circumstances and can be dated with considerable precision.

A coat of arms tells a story. The shield (*écu*) bears the family's hereditary charges. The helm (*casque*) indicates rank: a peer's helm faces the viewer; a knight's faces right; an esquire's faces right with the visor closed. The crest sits atop the helm. Supporters (figures flanking the shield) are reserved for peers and certain corporate bodies. A motto appears on a scroll below. Marshalling — the combination of arms from different families — records marriages: a husband's arms on the left (dexter) half of the shield, a wife's family arms on the right (sinister) half, creating a new composition with each generation.

For the provenance researcher, this means that a bookplate with marshalled arms can indicate not just *who* owned the book but *when* they owned it — specifically, after the marriage that produced the marshalling. A bookplate showing the arms of, say, the Comte de Ligne impaling those of the Princesse de Lorraine can be dated to within a few years of the relevant marriage. Combined with a knowledge of the family's library history, the bookplate becomes a remarkably precise dating tool.

The standard references for identifying armorial bookplates vary by country: Franks for Britain, Olivier-Hermal-Roton's *Manuel de l'amateur de reliures armoriées françaises* for France, Warnecke's *Die deutschen Bücherzeichen* for Germany, and various national society publications for smaller traditions. It is a field where specialisation is essential and generalism is humbling.

## The Ownership Inscription

Not everyone had — or wanted — a bookplate. For most of history, the commonest method of marking a book was simply to write in it. A name on the title page. A name on the flyleaf. A name and a date. A name, a date, and a price. A name, a date, a price, and a brief comment on how the book was acquired, creating, in a few lines of handwriting, a provenance record of startling completeness.

The range is enormous. At one end: "*J. Smith*" in faded pencil on a flyleaf, undated, uninformative, and essentially useless for provenance purposes. At the other: "*Acheté à la vente Giraud de Savine, Drouot, 12 mars 1897, lot 342, 15 francs. Exemplaire incomplet du portrait.*" — a complete acquisition record including sale, date, lot number, price, and a condition note, written by someone who understood that a book's history is part of its value.

Between these extremes lies the vast middle ground of inscriptions that are partially informative: a name that can be identified, a date that narrows the range, a location that suggests a context. "*C. van Hulthem, Gand*" in a book tells you a great deal if you know that Charles van Hulthem (1764–1832) was one of the greatest bibliophiles in the history of the Low Countries, whose collection of 60,000 volumes formed the nucleus of the Bibliothèque royale de Belgique. It tells you nothing if you don't.

**Presentation inscriptions** — books inscribed by the author to a specific recipient — occupy a special category. "For Ernest, with admiration" in the hand of a Nobel laureate transforms a reading copy into a relic. The inscription doesn't change the text. It changes the object — from one copy among thousands to a specific artifact with a documented relationship to the author. The market responds accordingly: a presentation copy of a significant literary work can sell for ten to fifty times the price of an unsigned copy in the same condition.

## The Stamp, the Label, and the Dymo

Below the bookplate and the inscription, in the hierarchy of ownership marks, lie the mechanical methods — practical, democratic, and generally disastrous for the books they adorn.

**Rubber stamps** appeared in the late nineteenth century and spread rapidly through institutional and personal collections alike. They are efficient, repeatable, and — this is the problem — permanent. A rubber stamp on a title page is indelible. It cannot be erased without damaging the paper. It can be bleached, but bleaching leaves a visible mark and weakens the paper fibres. A beautifully printed title page with a violet rubber stamp reading "BIBLIOTHÈQUE COMMUNALE DE SCHAERBEEK" across the centre has been permanently altered. The stamp has served its purpose. The title page has not survived intact.

**Adhesive labels** — printed paper labels glued to pastedowns or flyleaves — are the commercial descendant of the bookplate, produced cheaply and applied without ceremony. They do their job. They also, depending on the adhesive, stain the paper, resist removal, and leave rectangular ghosts that persist for centuries. The taxonomy of adhesive damage is familiar from price stickers and applies equally here.

**Dymo labels** — those raised-letter plastic strips produced by handheld embossing machines — had a brief and unfortunate vogue in the 1960s and 1970s. They were applied to spines, to boards, to flyleaves, and occasionally — in moments of what can only be described as bibliographic aggression — to title pages. The adhesive is aggressive. The plastic yellows. The labels peel at the corners but resist removal at the centre. They are, in every respect, the least sympathetic ownership mark ever devised, and their prevalence in collections assembled between 1960 and 1985 is a minor tragedy of twentieth-century book culture.

## What Your Method Says About You

There is an unspoken semiotics of ownership marks. The collector who commissions an engraved bookplate — designed by an artist, printed on quality paper, pasted with care on the front pastedown — is making a statement about permanence, about aesthetic seriousness, about the belief that a personal library is a cultural act, not just an accumulation. The tradition continues: contemporary bookplate artists (the field is small but active, with annual congresses organised by FISAE, the Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Amateurs d'Ex-Libris) produce work that ranges from traditional engraving to digital design.

The collector who writes a neat inscription in pencil on the front free endpaper — name, date, perhaps the place of purchase — is practicing the most conservative and least damaging form of ownership marking. Pencil can be erased. It does not stain. It does not bleed. It is the choice of the collector who thinks about the next owner, which is to say, the collector who understands that all ownership is temporary.

The collector who does nothing — who leaves no mark at all — creates a gap in the provenance record. This is, from a historical perspective, a loss. Your ownership is part of the book's story. A century from now, someone may try to reconstruct the book's journey from printer to present, and your silence will be a blank in the chain. Whether this troubles you is a matter of temperament. Whether it troubles the future bibliographer is certain.

Mark your books. Do it with care, with restraint, and with an awareness that the mark will outlast you. A pencil inscription on the front free endpaper. Your name, the date, the place of acquisition. Nothing more is needed. Nothing less is adequate.
