# Foxing, Browning, Toning: A Spotter's Guide to Book Diseases

*The science and vocabulary of paper degradation, for collectors who want to describe what's happening to their books without sounding like they're guessing.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

Open a book printed before 1950 and you will, sooner or later, encounter spots. Small, irregular, rust-coloured blemishes scattered across a page like a constellation designed by someone with a tremor. They may be few — a handful on the preliminaries, nothing on the text. They may be many — every page peppered, as though the book had developed measles. They are foxing, and they are the most common, most discussed, and least understood form of paper deterioration in the collector's vocabulary.

"Foxing" is also, not coincidentally, the term most frequently misused in book descriptions. It is applied indiscriminately to any brown spot on any old page, in the same way that "vintage" is applied to any object older than the person selling it. This imprecision matters, because different types of discolouration have different causes, different implications for the book's future, and different effects on its value. Knowing the difference is not pedantry. It is the difference between describing a book and describing it accurately.

## Foxing

The term "foxing" has been in use since at least the mid-nineteenth century, and its etymology is disputed. It may derive from the colour (fox-red). It may derive from the Old English *foxen* (to decay or become sour). It may derive from something else entirely. Etymologists disagree, which is their natural condition.

What is less disputed — though still actively researched — is the mechanism. Foxing spots are caused by one or both of two processes: **fungal growth** and **iron oxidation**.

The fungal theory holds that certain species of fungi — particularly *Aspergillus* and *Penicillium* — colonise paper in conditions of high humidity, feeding on the sizing (the gelatine or starch coating applied to paper to make it suitable for printing) and producing coloured metabolic byproducts. The spots are, in this reading, fungal colonies — small, discrete, and roughly circular because the fungus grows outward from a central point of colonisation. Under magnification, fungal foxing sometimes shows hyphal structures (the thread-like filaments of the fungal organism), and under ultraviolet light, some foxing spots fluoresce, suggesting biological activity.

The iron oxidation theory holds that foxing is caused by iron particles embedded in the paper during manufacture. Handmade paper, and much machine-made paper before the mid-twentieth century, was produced using metallic equipment — iron moulds, iron beaters, iron vats — and traces of iron inevitably entered the pulp. Over time, in the presence of moisture and oxygen, these particles oxidise (rust), producing the characteristic reddish-brown spots. Iron-catalysed foxing tends to be more sharply defined than fungal foxing and does not fluoresce under UV.

The current consensus, such as it exists, is that both mechanisms are real and that many cases of foxing involve both — the iron particles provide a substrate that fungi colonise preferentially, creating a symbiotic process of degradation. This is elegant in theory and deeply unhelpful in practice, because it means that a single foxing spot may be simultaneously a chemical reaction and a biological event, and treating one cause may not address the other.

For the collector, the practical implications are these: foxing is progressive in humid conditions, stable in dry ones, and largely irreversible without professional conservation treatment (which typically involves washing, deacidification, and sometimes bleaching — all of which carry their own risks). A book with "occasional light foxing to preliminaries" is in a different condition category from one with "heavy foxing throughout," and the distinction is not merely quantitative but qualitative: heavy foxing may indicate ongoing biological activity, while light, stable foxing may have been inactive for a century.

## Browning

Browning is the overall darkening of paper to a yellowish-brown or tobacco colour. Unlike foxing, which is localised, browning is general — it affects the entire leaf, or the entire book, more or less uniformly. It is the most visible sign of paper ageing and the one most frequently dismissed as inevitable.

It is not entirely inevitable. Browning is caused primarily by **acid hydrolysis** — the breakdown of cellulose fibres in the presence of acid. And the source of the acid, in most cases, is the paper itself.

From the mid-nineteenth century onward, the papermaking industry shifted from rag-based stock (cotton and linen fibres, which are naturally pH-neutral or slightly alkaline) to wood-pulp-based stock (which contains lignin, a complex organic polymer that breaks down into acidic compounds over time). The shift was driven by economics: rags were expensive and in limited supply; wood was cheap and abundant. The resulting paper was cheaper, whiter, and more uniform than rag paper. It also began destroying itself from the moment it was made.

The acid generated by lignin degradation attacks the cellulose chains that give paper its strength and flexibility. The paper becomes brittle, darkens to brown, and eventually crumbles. This is not a theoretical risk — it is the reason that a newspaper from 1950 is brown and fragile while a book printed in 1650 on rag paper is often supple and white. The older paper is better paper, not because of its age, but because of its chemistry.

The paper used for books was generally of higher quality than newsprint, but much of it — particularly in the period from roughly 1850 to 1990 — was acidic enough to cause significant browning over decades. The "brittle books" crisis that alarmed librarians in the 1980s was a direct consequence: millions of volumes from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were deteriorating faster than they could be preserved.

The response was twofold. Librarians developed mass deacidification programmes — chemical treatments that neutralise the acid in paper and deposit an alkaline buffer to prevent future acid formation. Publishers, eventually, began using acid-free paper (paper made with alkaline sizing rather than acidic sizing, often bearing the infinity symbol ∞ on the copyright page). If you collect modern first editions, that small symbol is worth looking for. It means the paper was made to last.

For the collector describing a book, "browning" means the paper has darkened from its original colour. "Toning" is often used as a synonym, though some catalogers draw a distinction: browning is darker and more advanced, toning is lighter and more uniform. The distinction is not standardised, which is a polite way of saying that different dealers use the terms differently and nobody has yet been imprisoned for it.

## Toning

Toning is the gentle, overall warming of paper from white (or off-white) to a pale cream or tan. It is the mildest form of age-related discolouration and, in many cases, is considered acceptable or even attractive — a patina that signals age without suggesting deterioration.

The causes overlap with browning: mild acid hydrolysis, oxidation of sizing materials, and exposure to light (particularly ultraviolet) all contribute. Toning is often most visible at the edges of leaves, where exposure to air and light is greatest, and least visible in the gutter (the inner margin near the spine), where the pages are protected by being pressed together.

"Age-toning" in a book description is generally understood as a neutral observation rather than a defect — roughly equivalent to saying "this book is old and looks old." Heavy toning, however, shades into browning, and the point at which toning becomes browning is a matter of judgment, experience, and the ambient lighting in the room where you're making the assessment.

## The Supporting Cast

Beyond the big three, several other forms of paper discolouration appear regularly in book descriptions and deserve precise language.

**Offset browning** (also called **migration** or **transfer**) occurs when acidic materials in contact with a page cause localised browning. The most common culprit is a newspaper clipping left between the pages — the acid in the newsprint transfers to the book paper, leaving a brown rectangle or a ghostly image of the clipping's text. Offset browning also occurs from acidic endpapers, from tissue guards (ironically, these were placed to protect engravings), from bookmarks left in place for decades, and from inserts of any acidic material.

**Tidelines** — the wavy, brown-edged marks left by water exposure — are not foxing, not browning, and not toning, though they are sometimes confused with all three. A tideline is the visible boundary where water-soluble compounds in the paper were carried to the edge of the wet area and deposited as the water evaporated. They are characteristic of localised water damage (a drip, a spill, a leak) as opposed to the generalised dampness that promotes foxing and mould.

**Mould staining** is darker, more irregular, and more alarming than foxing. Active mould appears as fuzzy, often coloured growth (black, green, grey, white) on the surface of the paper, and produces a characteristic musty smell. Inactive mould staining — the residue left after the mould has died — appears as dark, irregular blotches, sometimes with visible surface disruption. Mould is the one form of paper damage that constitutes a quarantine situation: a mouldy book should be isolated from the rest of the collection until the mould is confirmed inactive, because active mould will spread to adjacent volumes through airborne spores.

**Damp staining** is the general darkening, cockling (wrinkling), and softening of paper caused by prolonged exposure to moisture without direct water contact. A book stored in a damp cellar for decades may show damp staining throughout, with cockling of the leaves and a characteristic musty smell even in the absence of visible mould. The paper may feel soft or limp rather than crisp.

## Using the Language

The point of this vocabulary is not to impress other collectors at a book fair, though it will. The point is precision. A book described as having "some foxing" is described vaguely. A book described as having "scattered light foxing to preliminaries and fore-edge, text clean, no browning or toning" is described precisely — and the precise description tells a buyer exactly what to expect, allows meaningful comparison between copies, and establishes a condition baseline for future reference.

If you're cataloging your own collection — and you should be — the language matters for the same reasons. A condition note reading "some spots" is useless five years from now. A note reading "foxing to endpapers and first three leaves, stable, no progression since acquisition (2019)" is a conservation record. It tells future-you — or a future owner, or an insurer, or a dealer — what the condition was, when it was assessed, and whether it was changing.

Your books are ageing. This is not a crisis — it is a fact, and most forms of ageing are slow, stable, and cosmetic rather than structural. But naming what you see, accurately and consistently, is the first step in understanding it. A spot is not just a spot. It is evidence — of chemistry, of biology, of storage conditions, of the materials and methods used to make the paper — and it deserves to be described with the specificity that evidence demands.

Even if, most of the time, the evidence says: "This book was stored in someone's slightly damp spare room for forty years." Which, to be fair, is a provenance record of sorts.
