# A Brief History of Ruining Books with Price Stickers

*On adhesive, its victims, and the quiet rage of every collector who has ever tried to remove a label from a dust jacket with a hairdryer and a prayer.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

There are many ways to damage a book. Fire. Water. Insects. Neglect. Children. But none of these carries the particular sting of damage inflicted *by the people who sold it to you*. A flood is an act of God. A price sticker is an act of commerce, applied with casual indifference by someone who, in the time it took to press a label onto a dust jacket, destroyed more value than the price printed on it.

This is not hyperbole. A first edition of a collectible modern novel, in fine condition with a fine dust jacket, can lose 10–30% of its market value from a single sticker applied to the front panel. Not from the sticker itself — from what the sticker does when you try to remove it, and from what it does when you don't.

## A Taxonomy of Adhesive Atrocities

Not all stickers are created equal, and understanding the taxonomy is useful, if only to calibrate your despair.

**Paper labels with animal glue.** The oldest type, used by bookshops from the nineteenth century well into the mid-twentieth. Brown paper, handwritten or printed, affixed with hide glue or fish glue. These have one significant virtue: the adhesive is water-soluble. A damp cloth, patience, and a steady hand will usually remove them without damage. The label may leave a faint ghost — a rectangular area slightly different in tone from the surrounding surface — but the paper and the printing beneath are generally unharmed. If all price stickers had remained at this technological level, this article would not exist.

**Gummed paper labels.** A transitional form. Paper labels with a factory-applied gum backing, activated by moisture (lick and stick). Common from the 1940s through the 1970s. Similar to animal glue labels in behaviour: water-soluble, removable with care, generally benign. The gum can yellow over time, leaving a tan shadow on light-coloured surfaces, but the underlying damage is cosmetic rather than structural.

**Pressure-sensitive labels.** And here we arrive at the catastrophe.

Pressure-sensitive adhesives — the peel-and-stick labels that became ubiquitous in retail from the 1960s onward — are the single greatest source of sticker damage to books in the modern era. The adhesive is not water-soluble. It is a synthetic polymer — typically an acrylic or rubber-based compound — designed to form an immediate, permanent bond with whatever surface it touches. It was engineered for shipping cartons and retail packaging. It was not engineered for coated paper dust jackets, and it does not care.

Remove a pressure-sensitive label from a glossy dust jacket and you will, with near certainty, lift the surface coating with it. The result is a pale, matte rectangle on an otherwise glossy surface — visible, permanent, and unrepairable. The label is gone. The evidence of the label is not. It is a scar.

Leave the label in place and the adhesive migrates. Over years, it seeps into the paper, creating a dark, oily stain that spreads beyond the label's footprint. The stain is visible from the reverse of the jacket. It is permanent. No solvent will remove it without damaging the printing. The collector is left choosing between two forms of damage: the scar of removal or the stain of inaction. This is not a choice anyone should have to make about an object they paid money for.

**Thermal labels** — the type produced by barcode printers, common in chain bookshops from the 1990s onward — combine pressure-sensitive adhesive with the additional insult of being printed on paper that yellows and becomes brittle with age. The adhesive on thermal labels is often more aggressive than on standard pressure-sensitive labels, because the labels were designed for high-throughput retail environments where adhesion failure was a greater concern than the feelings of future collectors. This is a reasonable commercial priority. It is also a disaster for books.

**Security tags** — the adhesive-backed electromagnetic strips applied by bookshops to deter theft — are the nuclear option. They are designed to be irremovable. They succeed. A security tag on a dust jacket is, for practical purposes, a permanent addition, and removing it will almost certainly destroy the area of the jacket it covers. Some shops applied them to the inside of the boards, which is marginally less destructive. Some applied them to the dust jacket spine. Those shops are not forgiven.

## The Hall of Infamy

Certain retailers have earned a particular reputation among collectors. This is not a comprehensive list, but it is a representative one.

The **Strand Book Store** in New York is beloved by readers and dreaded by collectors. Their yellow price labels — handwritten, on bright yellow paper, affixed with an adhesive of remarkable tenacity — have been applied to millions of dust jackets since the shop opened in 1927. A "Strand sticker" is recognised worldwide and is, in the used book trade, a provenance mark of sorts, though not the kind anyone wants. The adhesive has a particular talent for bonding with the laminated jackets common on American books from the 1960s onward, creating a union that no solvent will dissolve without also dissolving the laminate.

On the Continent, the *bouquinistes* along the Seine are largely innocent — their stock predates the pressure-sensitive era, and a penciled price on a flyleaf is the worst you'll encounter. The chains are another matter. The FNAC's barcode stickers, applied with industrial efficiency across France and Belgium, have damaged more modern first editions of *Pléiade* volumes and Gallimard *Blanche* editions than any other single source. In Germany, the *Hugendubel* and *Thalia* chains use labels that could anchor a ship.

British charity shops — Oxfam, the British Heart Foundation, the RSPB — deserve a special mention for the sheer volume of stickers applied to donated books. The pricing is usually done by volunteers, with whatever labels are to hand, applied wherever seems convenient. "Convenient" is often the front panel of the dust jacket, directly over the artwork. The stickers are cheap, the adhesive is aggressive, and the placement suggests a worldview in which dust jackets are surfaces rather than artefacts. Collectors who browse charity shops — and most collectors browse charity shops — develop a reflex assessment: book, condition, sticker location, adhesive type, probability of clean removal. This calculation happens in under three seconds and is more sophisticated than it has any right to be.

The **supermarket barcode sticker** applied directly to a dust jacket is the most democratic form of book damage. It doesn't discriminate by value, by rarity, by beauty. It is applied by a pricing gun, in bulk, by someone who is also pricing tins of beans, and it treats books and beans with exactly the same level of care.

## The Art of Removal

Collectors have developed a pharmacopoeia of removal techniques, each with its advocates, its sceptics, and its casualties.

**Heat.** A hairdryer on low heat, held a few centimetres from the label for 30–60 seconds, softens pressure-sensitive adhesive enough to allow slow, careful peeling. This works reasonably well on uncoated paper and on some laminated jackets. It works poorly on matte-coated jackets, where the heat can cause the coating to separate from the paper substrate. The margin between "enough heat to soften the adhesive" and "enough heat to damage the jacket" is narrow, and the consequences of overshooting are immediate and irreversible.

**Solvents.** Lighter fluid (naphtha), petroleum ether, and commercial products like Un-Du are used to dissolve adhesive residue after label removal. Naphtha evaporates quickly and generally does not stain, but it can affect certain inks and coatings. Test on an inconspicuous area first. This advice is universally given and intermittently followed, usually because the inconspicuous area looks fine and the conspicuous area does not. Rubbing alcohol should be avoided on printed surfaces — it dissolves many printing inks on contact.

**Mechanical removal.** A fingernail, a bone folder, or a specialised crepe rubber eraser can roll up dried adhesive residue. This is tedious, slow, and safe, which is why almost nobody does it when a bottle of naphtha is within reach.

**Professional conservation.** For valuable books, the only responsible answer. A trained conservator has access to solvents, tools, and techniques that are not available to amateurs, and — more importantly — has the judgment to know when removal will cause more damage than leaving the label in place. "Do nothing" is sometimes the correct conservation decision, and it is the one that collectors find hardest to accept.

## The Modest Proposal

The solution is obvious, has been obvious for decades, and is almost universally ignored: **do not put adhesive labels on dust jackets.**

Price the book on a slip of paper inserted between the pages. Write the price in pencil on the rear flap, where it can be erased. Use a removable label on the Mylar protective cover, not on the jacket itself. Print a shelf tag. Use any of the dozen methods that booksellers employed perfectly well for centuries before the pressure-sensitive label was invented.

Some booksellers already do this. They are, without exception, the booksellers that collectors trust, return to, and recommend. The correlation is not coincidental. A bookseller who puts a sticker on a dust jacket is telling you something about how they think about books, and what they're telling you is that they think about books the way a greengrocer thinks about apples: as inventory, not as objects deserving of care.

The book will be here long after the sticker. The sticker should have the grace to leave no trace.
