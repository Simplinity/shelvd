# Cataloging on a Sunday: A Confession

*The ritualistic, slightly obsessive pleasure of spending a quiet afternoon entering bibliographic data. A love letter to the hobby nobody admits to enjoying.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

---

It is Sunday. The house is quiet. The coffee is made — the second pot, because the first one disappeared during the folios, and the folios are always slower than you think. The laptop is open. The stack of books is waiting: ten, maybe fifteen volumes, acquired over the past two weeks and sitting on the desk in the order they arrived, which is no order at all.

You pick up the first one. A French octavo, 1837, publisher's printed wrappers, uncut. You open it to the title page and begin.

Author. Title. Place of publication. Publisher. Date. Format. Pagination. Binding description. Condition notes. Provenance. Purchase source. Purchase date. Price.

This will take four minutes. It is, by any rational measure, a trivial task — data entry, the kind of work that office workers endure for a salary and that no sane person would do voluntarily on a Sunday afternoon. And yet here you are, and here I am, and if you're reading this article there is a reasonable chance that you know exactly what this feels like, and that you're not entirely willing to explain it to anyone who doesn't.

## The Ritual

There is a particular rhythm to cataloging that resists description but that every practitioner recognises. It is not exciting. It is not meditative, exactly, though it has some of the qualities of meditation — the narrowed focus, the absorption, the way time becomes elastic. It is closer, perhaps, to the experience of a watchmaker: small, precise movements applied to a defined task, with the satisfaction of seeing a mechanism come together one component at a time.

The ritual has steps. You develop them yourself, over months and years, and they become as fixed as a liturgy.

First: the physical examination. You hold the book. You feel the paper — rag or wood pulp, smooth or textured, thick or thin. You check the binding: firm? Shaken? Rebacked? You note the presence or absence of the dust jacket, the endpapers, the half-title, the errata leaf. You count the plates if there are plates to count. You note the foxing if there is foxing to note. You are not yet writing anything. You are looking.

Second: the title page. The source of truth. You transcribe what you see — not what you think it should say, not what the online catalog says, but what the title page *actually says*. The long-s that looks like an f. The ligatures. The imprint at the foot with its *chez* and its *rue* and its *privilège*. If the book is in a language you don't read — and in a polyglot collection, this happens regularly — you transcribe what you see and identify it later. The title page doesn't care whether you understand it. It is what it is.

Third: the entry. You type. Author, last name first — a convention that feels wrong until it becomes automatic, at which point it feels so right that seeing "Victor Hugo" instead of "Hugo, Victor" in someone else's catalog produces a small but genuine discomfort. Title, transcribed from the title page. Place, publisher, date. Format, determined by sheet folding or, for modern books, by measurement. Pagination: preliminary pages in Roman numerals, text pages in Arabic, plates counted separately, advertisements noted or ignored depending on your policy (I note them; advertisements are bibliographic evidence, and ignoring them is a minor sin).

Then the subjective fields. Condition: a brief, honest assessment in the vocabulary of the trade. Binding: what it is, what state it's in, whether it's original. Provenance: any marks, stamps, bookplates, inscriptions. And — the field that nobody else cares about but that you care about deeply — notes. The catch-all. The place where you record that this is the variant with the cancel title page, or that the frontispiece is in the second state, or that the previous owner has annotated the margins in a hand you can't read, or simply that you bought it at a stall in the Vieux Marché in Brussels on a Saturday morning in October and the dealer threw in a pamphlet for free.

Fourth: the photograph. Front board. Spine. Title page. Any notable features. Done.

Fifth: the shelf. You carry the book to its place — determined by whatever organisational scheme currently governs your library, which may be subject, or language, or format, or chronology, or the system you can't quite describe but that makes sense to you when you're standing in front of it. The book goes on the shelf. The entry is complete. You pick up the next one.

## Why We Do This

The honest answer is: I don't entirely know.

The practical justifications are real — a cataloged collection is searchable, insurable, manageable in ways that an uncataloged one is not. These are the reasons I give when someone asks. They are true. They are also insufficient. They explain why cataloging is useful. They don't explain why it's pleasurable.

Part of it is the satisfaction of order imposed on chaos. Fifteen books on a desk, miscellaneous and unrelated, become fifteen records in a database, each one identified, described, and assigned a place. The entropy of acquisition — the random accumulation of objects acquired for different reasons at different times from different sources — is replaced by the structured calm of a catalog entry. The book has been *processed*. It has moved from the pile of things-not-yet-dealt-with to the library of things-known. This feels disproportionately good.

Part of it is the excuse to handle books slowly. Buying a book is exciting. Reading a book is engaging. But *examining* a book — turning it over in your hands, checking the collation, reading the inscriptions, noting the binding — is a different kind of attention, slower and more tactile, and cataloging is the structured excuse to do it. Without the catalog, you might shelve a new acquisition in minutes. With the catalog, you spend four or five minutes with each one, and in those minutes you notice things — a binder's ticket, a variant imprint, a pencilled price from a dealer in the 1930s — that you would otherwise have missed.

Part of it is the cumulative record. A catalog, maintained over years, becomes a diary of a collecting life. Not a narrative diary — nobody wants to read about the afternoon you spent entering Belgian chapbooks — but a factual record of what you bought, where, when, and for how much. Open the catalog at a random page and you're looking at a moment: a book fair in Antwerp in March 2014, a lot at Drouot in May 2018, a dealer's catalog from Ghent that arrived on a Monday and produced three orders by Wednesday. The books are the nouns. The catalog is the sentence.

## The Sunday Afternoon

There is a specific quality to Sunday cataloging that weekday cataloging doesn't have. It is unhurried. There is no deadline, no obligation, no task waiting behind it. The afternoon stretches. The stack shrinks. The coffee cools and is reheated and cools again.

Sometimes you encounter a book that takes longer than the others — a sixteenth-century edition that needs collation checking, or a title you can't find in any reference, or a binding that you suspect is by a specific workshop but need to verify. These are the detours, and they are the best part. You pull a reference book from the shelf — Brunet, or VD17, or the *Manuel de l'amateur de reliures* — and check. Sometimes you find the answer. Sometimes you don't, and you add a note ("Workshop unidentified — compare with Goldschmidt, pl. XLVII?") and move on. The note is a seed. It may grow into a research question, or it may sit in the database forever, unresolved, a small monument to a Sunday afternoon's curiosity.

Sometimes a book surprises you. The copy you bought for €20 at a village *brocante* turns out to be a variant not recorded in the bibliography. The book you inherited from your grandfather, which you always assumed was a common reprint, turns out to be a first edition in original wrappers. These moments — rare, unpredictable, disproportionately thrilling — are the buried treasure of cataloging. They come only to those who look carefully, which means they come only to those who catalog.

## The Confession

The title of this article promises a confession, so here it is: I enjoy cataloging more than I am comfortable admitting.

I enjoy the precision. I enjoy the small, repeatable discipline of looking at a book and describing what I see. I enjoy the way a catalog entry, properly constructed, captures the essential identity of a physical object in a few fields of structured data. I enjoy the slow Sunday afternoons, the stacks that shrink, the shelves that fill, the database that grows.

I enjoy it in the way that some people enjoy gardening, or model-building, or any other quiet, structured activity that produces visible results through sustained, careful attention. It is not glamorous. It will never be glamorous. It is the unglamorous counterpart to the glamorous act of buying, and without it the buying is just accumulation.

If you've read this far, you probably know what I'm talking about. You've probably done it yourself — sat down on a quiet afternoon with a stack of books and a spreadsheet (or a database, or an index card box, or a beautifully ruled ledger, because the tools vary but the impulse is the same) and entered records until the light changed and the afternoon was gone.

And if you haven't — if your books are still uncataloged, still in their stacks, still waiting — then consider this an invitation. Pick a Sunday. Make coffee. Start with the shelf nearest to you. One book at a time.

You may discover that the quietest part of collecting is also the most satisfying.
