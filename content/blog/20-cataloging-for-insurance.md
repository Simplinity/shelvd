# Cataloging Your Library for Insurance (Before You Need To)

*What your insurer actually needs, how to document condition, what "replacement value" means for a book that can't be replaced, and why your phone camera is now a conservation tool.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

Nobody catalogs their library for insurance purposes until they need to, at which point it is too late. This is the fundamental paradox of insurance documentation: the moment you need the records is the moment you can no longer create them, because the event that triggered the need — fire, flood, theft, the slowly spreading damp patch that went unnoticed for three years — has destroyed or damaged the very objects you need to document.

The time to catalog your library for insurance is now. Not next month. Not when you've "got the system set up." Now. With whatever tools you have, in whatever format you can manage, starting with whatever shelf is nearest.

This is the unglamorous article. It has no literary charm. It will save you tens of thousands of euros.

## What Your Insurer Needs

Insurance companies, whether you're dealing with a specialist like AXA Art, Hiscox, or a local Belgian or Dutch insurer, need to establish three things about a claimed loss: that you owned the item, that the item had the value you claim, and that the item was in the condition you claim. Everything they ask for serves one of these three purposes.

**Proof of ownership.** Purchase receipts, auction invoices, dealer correspondence, inheritance records, gift documentation. For books acquired at auction, the invoice from the house is definitive — it identifies the lot, the hammer price, the premium, and the buyer. For books acquired from dealers, the receipt should ideally describe the book (not just "1 book — €500" but "Rabelais, *Gargantua*, Lyon, Juste, 1542, 8vo, contemporary vellum — €500"). For books inherited, a copy of the will or estate inventory. For books acquired at fairs, flea markets, or *brocantes* — where receipts are rare — a contemporaneous entry in your catalog, with date and source, is the best available evidence.

Keep every receipt. Every invoice. Every email confirmation. In a folder, physical or digital, separate from the books themselves. If your books are destroyed in a fire, the receipts stored next to them are destroyed too. Redundancy is the point.

**Proof of value.** For recently purchased books, the purchase price is the starting point — but not the end point, because books appreciate (and occasionally depreciate). For books held for years or decades, current market value may differ substantially from the purchase price.

Market value is established by **comparable sales** — recent auction results for the same or similar copies. The major auction databases (Invaluable, Mutualart, the Livre Rare Book database, the *Jahrbuch der Auktionspreise* for German-speaking markets) provide searchable records of past sales, including descriptions, condition notes, and hammer prices. If your copy of a particular title is comparable in edition and condition to a copy that sold at Christie's last year for £8,000, that is your current market value — not the £2,000 you paid for it in 2009.

For books that rarely or never appear at auction, valuation is harder. A formal **appraisal** by a qualified expert — a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association (ABA) in Britain, the Syndicat de la Librairie Ancienne et Moderne (SLAM) in France, the Internationale Liga der Antiquariatsbuchhandler (ILAB) internationally, or the Chambre Syndicale in Belgium — carries weight with insurers and is often required for collections above a certain value threshold. Appraisals should be updated periodically — every three to five years for significant collections — because the market moves and what was worth €5,000 in 2015 may be worth €8,000 or €3,000 today.

**Proof of condition.** This is where most collectors fail, and where most insurance claims become contested. You say the book was Fine. The insurer's adjuster — who may or may not know anything about books — sees a damaged object and has no baseline for comparison. Was the foxing there before the flood? Was the binding already weak before the shelf collapsed? Without documentation, these become arguments. Arguments with insurers are expensive, slow, and rarely satisfying.

## The Minimum Viable Record

Not every book in your collection needs a detailed condition report. Your paperback copy of *Maigret et le clochard* does not require photographic documentation. But every book of significant value — and "significant" means whatever amount would hurt if you lost it — needs at minimum:

1. **Identification.** Author, title, place of publication, publisher, date, edition statement. Enough to identify the specific edition unambiguously.

2. **Physical description.** Format, binding material, dust jacket (present/absent/condition), pagination or collation, illustrations (type, number, completeness).

3. **Condition summary.** A brief, honest description of the book's current condition, noting any defects: foxing, staining, repairs, missing elements, binding damage, restoration.

4. **Value.** Purchase price and date, and/or current estimated market value with source (auction comparable, dealer estimate, formal appraisal).

5. **Provenance.** Any ownership marks, bookplates, inscriptions, or documentation that connects the book to previous owners.

6. **Photographs.** At minimum: front board, spine, rear board, title page, any significant defects. For books with dust jackets: front panel, spine, rear panel, flaps. For books of high value: additional images of bindings, illustrations, inscriptions, condition issues.

This sounds like a lot. It is not. For a book of moderate value, the entire record can be created in five minutes: two minutes of description, one minute of photography, two minutes of data entry. For a collection of 500 valuable books, that is roughly 40 hours of work — spread across weekends, it is a month or two. It is not a pleasant month. It is a useful one.

## Photography as Conservation

Your phone camera is, without exaggeration, the most important conservation tool you own. Not because it preserves books — it doesn't — but because it preserves *information about books*, and information is what you need when the books themselves are compromised.

A photograph taken today of a book in its current condition is a baseline document. If the book is subsequently damaged — by water, by handling, by the slow creep of foxing — the photograph shows what the condition was before the damage occurred. This is invaluable for insurance claims, but it is also invaluable for conservation: a conservator treating a damaged book benefits enormously from knowing what the book looked like before the damage, and a photograph is the most reliable record.

Photograph your books systematically. Not artistically — systematically. Consistent lighting (natural daylight or a desk lamp, avoiding flash). Consistent framing (the whole board, not a close-up of the tooling, unless both are taken). A ruler or colour card in the frame for scale and colour reference, if you want to be thorough. File the photographs with the catalog records, named consistently (author-title-front.jpg, author-title-spine.jpg), and store them in at least two locations — your computer and a cloud service, or your computer and an external drive kept at a different address.

The photographs you take on a Sunday afternoon in February, when the task feels pointless and the light is grey, are the photographs that will matter most when something goes wrong on a Tuesday in October.

## Replacement Value vs. Market Value

Insurance policies for collectibles typically offer one of two valuation bases: **market value** (what the item would sell for at auction or through a dealer) or **replacement value** (what it would cost to acquire a comparable item). These are not the same, and the difference matters.

Market value is the hammer price — what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. Replacement value is higher, because replacing a specific book involves search costs, dealer margins, and the premium of buying from retail rather than at auction. A book that would sell at auction for €3,000 might cost €5,000–€6,000 to replace from a dealer's stock, because the dealer's margin, overhead, and expertise are built into the price.

For unique or extremely rare items, "replacement value" becomes philosophical. What is the replacement value of the only known copy of a book? Of a copy with a unique provenance? Of a presentation copy inscribed by the author? Strictly, these items are irreplaceable, and any valuation is an agreed fiction — a number that both you and the insurer accept as a reasonable approximation of loss, knowing that no amount of money will produce a second copy.

Most specialist insurers understand this and will work with you (and, if necessary, with an independent appraiser) to establish agreed values for exceptional items. The agreed-value policy — where specific items are listed at specific values, and those values are paid in full in the event of a total loss — is the standard for serious collections and the one you should insist on.

## Storage and Risk

Your insurer will also care about how and where the books are stored, because storage conditions directly affect risk.

**Fire.** Books burn. Your insurer will want to know about smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and proximity to heat sources. For high-value collections, a fire-rated safe or vault may be required or may reduce your premium. Sprinkler systems protect the building but damage the books — water damage from sprinklers is, for a book collection, a secondary disaster. This is a conversation worth having with your insurer before you need to have it.

**Water.** The most common cause of damage to private collections. Leaking roofs, burst pipes, flooding. Books stored in basements or on the ground floor are at highest risk. Books stored on the top shelf are at lowest risk. This is not coincidence; it is physics. Your insurer may require that high-value items are stored above flood level, and they are right to do so.

**Theft.** Rare books are portable, valuable, and — crucially — difficult to identify if stolen. Unlike paintings, which are visually unique and recognisable, books are mass-produced objects that differ from other copies only in minor details. A stolen first edition looks exactly like every other copy of the same edition. This makes recovery difficult and documentation essential. Your catalog — with its descriptions, photographs, and condition notes — is the primary tool for identifying a stolen book and proving ownership. Without it, the book is gone.

**Climate.** Temperature and humidity fluctuations cause more long-term damage to books than any other factor. Ideal conditions — 18–20°C, 45–55% relative humidity, stable — are rarely achievable in a private home without climate control. Your insurer may not care about this directly, but your books do, and damage caused by poor storage conditions is typically excluded from coverage.

## The Conversation You Don't Want to Have

If the worst happens — fire, flood, theft — you will have a conversation with a loss adjuster. This person's job is to assess the validity and value of your claim. They will ask for documentation. They will ask for receipts. They will ask for photographs. They will ask for your catalog.

If you have these things, the conversation is straightforward. Painful, because you've lost books you cared about, but straightforward. The documentation supports the claim. The claim is paid. You begin, if you choose, the long process of rebuilding.

If you don't have these things, the conversation is adversarial. You say you owned a first edition worth €10,000. The adjuster says: prove it. You can't. The claim is reduced, delayed, or denied. The loss is compounded by the loss of the claim. And the time you didn't spend cataloging — the weekends you spent buying books instead of documenting them — becomes the most expensive time you ever saved.

Catalog your books. Photograph them. Store the records safely. Do it now.

The insurance article is never the one anyone wants to read. It is always the one everyone wishes they had.
