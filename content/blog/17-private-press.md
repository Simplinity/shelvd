# The Private Press and Why It Matters

*Kelmscott, Doves, Ashendene, Cranach, De Zilverdistel — the tradition of printing books as objects of beauty rather than commerce. What makes them different, why they're collected, and why a nineteenth-century socialist started a revolution with a typeface.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

In 1891, William Morris — textile designer, poet, socialist agitator, and the most restlessly productive man in Victorian England — bought a printing press, installed it in a cottage near his house in Hammersmith, and began printing books. He did this because he believed, with the particular fury of a craftsman watching an industrial revolution, that the printed book had become ugly.

He was not wrong. The mass-produced book of the late nineteenth century — machine-set, machine-printed, machine-bound, on cheap acidic paper — was a triumph of economy and a disaster of aesthetics. Morris wanted to prove that a book could be both well-made and beautiful, that typography and layout and paper and ink were not costs to be minimised but materials to be celebrated. He called his workshop the Kelmscott Press, and in the seven years before his death in 1896 he produced 53 titles in 66 volumes, culminating in the monumental *Works of Geoffrey Chaucer* — 556 pages, 87 woodcut illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones, printed in red and black in Morris's own Golden type on handmade paper.

The Kelmscott Chaucer is, by any measure, one of the most beautiful books ever produced. It is also, by any measure, the founding text of the private press movement — the tradition of printing books as objects of beauty rather than commerce, by hand rather than by machine, in limited editions rather than mass runs. Everything that came after Morris began because Morris began.

## What Makes a Private Press

The term "private press" is debated, as all useful terms are, but a working definition would include most of the following characteristics:

The press prints for artistic or literary rather than purely commercial reasons. The editions are small — typically between 100 and 500 copies, though some go lower and a few go higher. The typography is given primary attention: type is chosen or designed for the purpose, set by hand (or, in later presses, machine-set with hand-press standards of care), and printed on handmade or mouldmade paper. The binding is part of the design, not an afterthought. And the whole enterprise is directed by an individual or a small group with a specific aesthetic vision, rather than by a publisher responding to market demand.

The private press is, in essence, the book as a *gesamtkunstwerk* — a total work of art, in which every element is controlled and every detail is intentional. This distinguishes it from fine commercial printing (which may be beautiful but is produced for the market) and from artists' books (which may be handmade but are typically conceived as visual art rather than as vehicles for text).

## The British Tradition

The private press movement found its most fertile ground in Britain, where Morris's example inspired a generation of printers who shared his values, if not always his politics.

**The Doves Press** (1900–1916), founded by T.J. Cobden-Sanderson and Emery Walker in Hammersmith — literally around the corner from Kelmscott — pursued a different ideal. Where Morris's books were richly decorated, the Doves Press was radically austere: no illustrations, no ornament, just the Doves type (designed by Walker, arguably the finest roman typeface of the twentieth century) on handmade paper, in layouts of crystalline clarity. The Doves Press Bible (1903–1905), five folio volumes, is a summit of typographic purity. Cobden-Sanderson, after falling out with Walker over ownership of the type, famously threw the punches and matrices into the Thames from Hammersmith Bridge in 1916. The type lay on the riverbed for nearly a century before a portion was recovered in 2015.

**The Ashendene Press** (1895–1935), run by C.H. St John Hornby at his home in Hertfordshire, produced some of the most sumptuously printed books of the period — large formats, handmade paper from Italian mills, type based on the Subiaco fount used by Sweynheym and Pannartz in their 1465 edition of Lactantius. Hornby's *Dante* (1909), printed in red and black with woodcut initials, is routinely cited as one of the masterpieces of the private press movement.

**The Nonesuch Press** (1923–1968), founded by Francis Meynell, took a deliberately different approach: using machine printing and commercially available typefaces, but with the design standards of a private press. The Nonesuch editions were larger (typically 1,000–1,500 copies), more affordable, and more widely distributed than those of Kelmscott or Doves. Meynell's aim was democratic fine printing — the well-made book available to the many, not just the few. The Nonesuch *Shakespeare* (1929–1933), seven volumes, designed by Meynell and printed at the University Press, Cambridge, is a landmark of twentieth-century book design.

**The Golden Cockerel Press** (1920–1961) combined fine printing with original illustration, commissioning wood engravings from some of the finest British artists of the century: Eric Gill, Robert Gibbings, John Nash, David Jones. The Golden Cockerel *Canterbury Tales* (1929–1931), with Gill's engravings, is both a masterpiece of illustration and a collector's trophy. Gill's involvement with the press — he also designed the proprietary Golden Cockerel typeface — produced some of his finest work, though his personal legacy is, to say the least, complicated.

## The Continental Tradition

The private press was not exclusively a British phenomenon, and the Continental tradition — less well-known in the anglophone world but equally significant — deserves more attention than it usually receives.

**The Cranach Press** (1913–1931), founded by Count Harry Kessler in Weimar, was perhaps the most ambitious private press of the twentieth century. Kessler was a diplomat, aesthete, and patron of extraordinary range — his friends and collaborators included Rodin, Maillol, van de Velde, Gordon Craig, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The Cranach Press produced books of an internationalism unmatched by any British press: Virgil's *Eclogues* (1926) with woodcuts by Maillol, printed in a type designed by Edward Johnston (creator of the London Underground typeface) and Emery Walker; Shakespeare's *Hamlet* (1930) with woodcuts by Gordon Craig, in a type based on a Mainz fount of 1465. The press was closed by the Nazi regime. Kessler died in exile in Lyon in 1937.

**De Zilverdistel** (The Silver Thistle, 1910–1923) in The Hague, and later **De Kunera Pers** and **Joh. Enschedé en Zonen** in Haarlem, carried the private press tradition in the Netherlands. De Zilverdistel, founded by J.F. van Royen, produced elegant editions in types designed by Lucien Pissarro and S.H. de Roos (whose Hollandsche Mediæval typeface became a defining element of Dutch typography). The Dutch tradition emphasised typographic clarity over decorative richness — a reflection of the country's strong tradition of functional design.

**The Officina Bodoni** (1922–1977), founded by Giovanni Mardersteig in Montagnola, Switzerland, and later moved to Verona, produced some of the most technically accomplished private press books of the century. Mardersteig, a German-born printer trained in the traditions of fine Continental typography, printed in types that included original designs (Griffo, Zeno, Pacioli) as well as historical typefaces cast from original matrices obtained from the Bodoni Museum in Parma. His edition of Boccaccio's *Decameron* is a touchstone, but even his smaller productions — slim volumes of poetry, exhibition catalogs, typographic specimens — demonstrate a level of craft that few printers have equalled.

In **France**, the tradition of the *livre d'artiste* — the book as a collaboration between publisher, artist, and author — overlaps with but is distinct from the private press. Ambroise Vollard's editions with lithographs by Bonnard, Picasso, and Chagall; the publications of Tériade (*Verve* magazine, Matisse's *Jazz*); the editions of Iliazd (Ilia Zdanevich) in Paris — these are not private press books in the strict sense, but they share the commitment to the book as an art object. The *livre d'artiste* tradition is collected separately, with its own dealers, its own fairs (the Salon du Livre Rare et de l'Objet d'Art at the Grand Palais), and its own price stratosphere.

In **Belgium**, the Flemish fine press tradition includes notable practitioners like Desclée de Brouwer in Bruges (primarily a Catholic publisher but with fine press ambitions), and more recently presses like Het Balanseer in Ghent, which operates at the intersection of contemporary art and book production.

## What Collectors Pay For

Private press books are collected for the confluence of design, craft, and scarcity. A Kelmscott Press book is collected not because of the text (which is available in a thousand other editions) but because of the object — the paper, the type, the ink, the woodcuts, the binding, the total design. The text is the occasion for the book. The book is the point.

Prices vary enormously by press, title, and condition. The Kelmscott Chaucer, of which 425 copies were printed on paper and 13 on vellum, currently sells for £100,000–£200,000 on paper and has exceeded £1 million on vellum. A minor Kelmscott title might be had for £500–£2,000. Doves Press books range from £300 for a slim volume to £200,000+ for the Bible. Ashendene and Cranach occupy a similar range. Nonesuch editions, produced in larger numbers, are more accessible: £50–£500 for most titles, with the major sets commanding more.

The market for Continental private press books is less developed than for their British equivalents — partly because the tradition is less well-documented in English, partly because the collecting base is smaller. This means that exceptional books by Mardersteig, Kessler, or De Zilverdistel can sometimes be acquired for prices that would be impossible for equivalent British presses. This is an opportunity, if you know where to look.

## Why It Matters Now

In a world of digital text, print-on-demand, and e-readers, the private press might seem like an anachronism — a beautiful irrelevance, preserved in collectors' cabinets and library vaults. It is not. The private press tradition asks a question that has never been more relevant: what is a book, when the text is everywhere?

The answer, for the private press, has always been: a book is not a text. A book is a physical object — designed, printed, bound, and intended to be held, opened, read, and kept. The text is necessary but not sufficient. The paper, the type, the ink, the margins, the binding — all of these are part of the experience of reading, and all of them can be done well or done badly.

Morris understood this in 1891. Mardersteig understood it in Verona. Kessler understood it in Weimar. And every collector who has held a Doves Press page — plain text, no decoration, just the best type on the best paper with the best ink — and felt the difference between a printed page and a *printed page*, understands it still.

The private press is not a genre. It is an argument — that the physical book deserves the same attention, the same craft, the same artistic ambition as the text it carries. It is an argument worth collecting.
