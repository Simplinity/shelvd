# Rebinding Is Not a Dirty Word

*When rebinding saves a book and when it destroys its value. The ethics and economics of putting a seventeenth-century text block in a nineteenth-century binding, and how to tell a sympathetic rebind from a crime against bibliography.*

**By Bruno van Branden**

Say "rebound" at a book fair and watch the room divide. Half the dealers will shrug — a rebound book is a fact of life, a practical reality for any text that has survived three or four centuries of use. The other half will wince, as though you've announced a death in the family. The binding, they will tell you, was original. The binding was *part of the book*. The binding is gone, and something has been lost that no amount of craftsmanship can replace.

Both camps are right, which is what makes the question interesting.

## The Case for Rebinding

A book that has been read, shelved, moved, lent, dropped, stored in an attic, rescued from a flood, and read again over the course of four hundred years has, in many cases, worn out its binding. The sewing has broken. The boards are detached. The spine is gone or crumbling. The leaves are loose. The book, as a functional object — as something you can hold open and read — has ceased to work.

At this point, you have three options: leave it as it is (a loose pile of leaves in a broken cover), put it in a box (preservation without function), or rebind it (restoration of function at the cost of the original binding).

For working libraries — university collections, reference libraries, institutional holdings where the text is the point — rebinding has always been the obvious choice. The Bodleian Library, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the university libraries of Leiden, Göttingen, and Leuven have been rebinding their collections for centuries. A book in a sound modern binding can be consulted, shelved, and lent. A book in a broken original binding cannot. The calculus is simple: access to the text is more important than the preservation of the binding.

The great institutional binders — firms like Zaehnsdorf and Rivière in London, Lortic and Chambolle-Duru in Paris, the Officina Bodoni's associated workshops in Verona — produced bindings of exceptional quality, often surpassing the originals in materials and technique. A seventeenth-century text block in a nineteenth-century full morocco binding by Trautz-Bauzonnet is not a diminished book. It is a book that has been given a new body by one of the finest craftsmen in the history of the trade.

## The Case Against Rebinding

And yet.

The original binding is evidence. It tells you where the book was bound (which may differ from where it was printed), when it was bound (which may differ from when it was published), what materials were available, what styles were current, who the first owner was (if the binding was commissioned), and how the book was used. A sixteenth-century limp vellum binding on a quarto printed in Basel tells a different story from a contemporary tooled calf binding on the same text — the first suggests a working copy, the second a presentation piece or a collector's commission. Remove the binding and you remove the story.

For incunabula and early printed books, the binding is frequently the most informative part of the physical object. Workshops can be identified by their tools — the stamps, rolls, and panels used to decorate the leather — and attributed to specific binders in specific cities using reference works like Einbanddatenbank (the German binding database, containing over 80,000 rubbings) or Goldschmidt's *Gothic and Renaissance Bookbindings*. A binding identified as the work of, say, the Meister der Dornenkrone in Erfurt or the atelier of Josse Bade in Paris is a historical document in its own right — evidence of the book trade, the decorative arts, and the intellectual networks of its period.

Rebinding destroys this evidence. Permanently. The new binding may be technically superior. It may be aesthetically pleasing. But the information carried by the original — its tools, its materials, its structure, its wear patterns, its repairs — is gone. You cannot reconstruct a binding from a rebind any more than you can reconstruct a face from a death mask. The shape is there. The life is not.

## The Spectrum of Intervention

The choice between rebinding and not rebinding is not binary. Conservation practice has developed a spectrum of interventions, each with its own level of intrusion and its own trade-offs.

**Consolidation.** The least invasive option: stabilising the existing binding without replacing anything. A broken joint is reinforced with Japanese tissue. A loose board is reattached. Loose leaves are tipped or guarded back in. Torn leather is consolidated with adhesive. The original binding is preserved, repaired, and made functional — or at least stable — without removing or replacing structural elements. This is the approach favoured by modern conservation ethics, and it is the right choice for any binding with historical or evidential value.

**Resewing.** If the sewing has broken and the text block has separated into loose sections, the book may need to be resewn — pulled apart, the sections cleaned and repaired, and sewn back together on new supports. This is more invasive than consolidation but preserves the text block's original structure. The original boards and covering material can sometimes be reattached to the new sewing, preserving the external appearance of the binding while renewing its internal structure.

**Rebacking.** A book whose spine leather has deteriorated — cracked, flaking, lost — can be rebacked: the boards and their covering material are retained, but the spine is replaced with new leather or cloth. A well-executed reback is difficult to detect and preserves most of the original binding's appearance and evidence. A poorly executed reback — wrong leather, wrong colour, wrong grain, clumsy joints — is immediately obvious and permanently disfiguring.

**Full rebinding.** The original covering material is removed entirely and replaced with new material — leather, cloth, vellum, or paper. The text block may or may not be resewn. The original boards may or may not be retained. At its best (a sympathetic rebind in period-appropriate materials, by a skilled craftsman), the result is a beautiful and functional book that has lost its original covering but gained a new one of quality. At its worst (cheap cloth over the original boards, machine-sewn, with the margins trimmed to fit a standard size), it is a desecration.

## The Economics

Rebinding affects value. How much, and in which direction, depends on what was replaced and what replaced it.

A common sixteenth-century text in a modern library binding: the rebind reduces value, but moderately, because the original binding on a common book was not the primary source of its worth. The buyer is paying for the text, the date, and the physical survival. The binding is a loss, but a tolerable one.

The same sixteenth-century text in a fine signed binding by a nineteenth-century master — Trautz-Bauzonnet, Capé, Duru, Lortic, Simier — is a different proposition. The rebind is itself collectible. There is an active market for fine bindings by named binders, and a book in a Trautz-Bauzonnet binding may sell for more than the same text in its original (but worn) sixteenth-century calf. The binding has become part of the book's value rather than a subtraction from it. The Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, the Bibliothèque Wittockiana in Brussels — institutions devoted to the art of the book — collect bindings as objects in their own right.

A modern first edition in a rebind: catastrophic. The collecting market for twentieth-century books places an extreme premium on original condition. A first edition of *Le Grand Meaulnes* (1913) in its original printed wrappers — even worn, even chipped — is worth many times what the same text in a fine later binding would fetch. The wrappers *are* the book, in the collector's sense. Replace them and you've replaced the collectibility.

The general rule, which admits many exceptions: the older the book, the less damage a rebind does to its market value. The more modern the book, the more damage. This is because the market for early printed books values text and rarity above condition, while the market for modern firsts values original condition above almost everything else.

## How to Identify a Rebind

Recognising a rebind is a fundamental skill for any collector, and it is not always easy. A good rebind is designed to look like it belongs. A great rebind may be almost invisible. But there are tells.

**The binding doesn't match the book's date.** The most obvious indicator. A book printed in 1580 in a Romantic-period binding (gold-tooled red morocco with wide dentelles) has been rebound — probably in the early nineteenth century, when collectors like Charles Nodier and Antoine-Augustin Renouard commissioned elaborate bindings for their libraries. The style is beautiful but anachronistic. The original binding would have been very different.

**The endpapers don't match.** Original endpapers are typically contemporary with the book — the same paper stock, the same age, the same level of toning. Rebound books often have newer endpapers: whiter, crisper, sometimes decorated with marbled paper from a different period. If the endpapers look fifty years younger than the text, the book has been rebound.

**The margins are narrow.** Rebinding often involves trimming the text block to produce clean, even edges. A book with unusually narrow margins — particularly at the head and fore-edge — may have been trimmed during rebinding. In extreme cases, trimming cuts into the printed text or the page numbers, which is visible and definitive. For early books, generous margins are a positive indicator of an untrimmed (and therefore probably unrebound) copy.

**The sewing structure is wrong.** This requires opening the book and examining the spine, which is not always possible or appropriate. But if you can see the sewing (at the head or tail, or by gently opening the book at the centre of a gathering), look for consistency with the period. A sixteenth-century book sewn on recessed cords (where the sewing supports are set into channels cut in the spine) has probably been resewn — the original would have been sewn on raised cords, visible as the familiar horizontal ridges on the spine.

**The binder's label.** Many binders, particularly from the nineteenth century onward, placed a small label — *relié par*, *bound by* — on the front or rear pastedown or turn-in. This is both a signature and a confession: the book has been rebound, and the binder is telling you so. The labels of major binders (Rivière, Zaehnsdorf, Sangorski & Sutcliffe in London; Marius Michel, Mercier, Gruel in Paris; the Koninklijke Boekbinderij in The Hague) are documented and datable.

## The Ethical Question

Modern conservation ethics hold a clear position: an original binding should be preserved whenever possible, and rebinding should be a last resort. The principle is codified in institutional conservation policies worldwide and is summarised by a single idea — *reversibility*. Any intervention should, ideally, be reversible: capable of being undone by a future conservator without loss of original material.

Rebinding is not reversible. The original covering, once removed, is gone. The evidence it carried is gone. The decision to rebind is, therefore, a decision to destroy evidence in exchange for functionality — and the ethical question is whether the exchange is justified.

For a unique binding with identifiable tools, historical significance, or provenance value: no. Preserve, consolidate, box if necessary, but do not rebind. For a common binding in poor condition, on a text that needs to be functional: possibly. For a broken binding with no particular evidential or aesthetic value: yes, and without guilt.

Rebinding is not a dirty word. But it is an irreversible one. Know what you're losing before you decide to lose it.
